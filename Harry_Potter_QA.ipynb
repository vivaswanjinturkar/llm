Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n6\\nCHAPTER ONE\\nTHE DARK LORD ASCENDING\\nT\\nhe two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow,\\nmoonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each\\nother’s chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands be-\\nneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.\\n“News?” asked the taller of the two.\\n“The best,” replied Severus Snape.\\nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the\\nright by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks flapped\\naround their ankles as they marched.\\n“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and\\nout of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. “It\\nwas a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You\\nsound confident that your reception will be good?”\\nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide\\ndriveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running\\noff into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barr-\\ning the men’s way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n7\\nleft arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark\\nmetal were smoke.\\nThe yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There was a\\nrustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it\\nover his companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing\\nmore than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the\\nhedge.\\n“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks...” Yaxley thrust his wand\\nback under his cloak with a snort.\\nA handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the\\nstraight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows.\\nSomewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing.\\nGravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the\\nfront door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had\\nvisibly opened it.\\nThe hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a\\nmagnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the\\npalefaced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode\\npast. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next\\nroom, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze\\nhandle.\\nThe drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate\\ntable. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the\\nwalls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble\\nmantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for\\na moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of\\nlight, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an appa-\\nrently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table,\\nrevolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the\\nmirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the\\npeople seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n8\\npale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to\\nprevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.\\n“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. “You\\nare very nearly late.”\\nThe speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was\\ndifficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette.\\nAs they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless,\\nsnakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were\\nvertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.\\n“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate\\nright. “Yaxley – beside Dolohov.”\\nThe two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table\\nfollowed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.\\n“So?”\\n“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from\\nhis current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”\\nThe interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others\\nfidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.\\n“Saturday... at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon\\nSnape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked\\naway, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the\\nferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort’s\\nface and, after a moment or two, Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into\\nsomething like a smile.\\n“Good. Very good. And this information comes –”\\n“– from the source we discussed,” said Snape. “My Lord.”\\nYaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and\\nSnape. All faces turned to him.\\n“My Lord, I have heard differently.”\\nYaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, “Dawlish,\\nthe Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n9\\nbefore the boy turns seventeen.”\\nSnape was smiling.\\n“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be\\nit. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would\\nnot be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.”\\n“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said Yaxley.\\n“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape. “I assure\\nyou, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of\\nHarry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.”\\n“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sitting a\\nshort distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here\\nand there along the table.\\nVoldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body\\nrevolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.\\n“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors\\nwill be used to transfer the boy –”\\nVoldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once,\\nwatching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.\\n“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”\\n“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place, according to\\nthe source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry\\ntogether could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once\\nhe is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next\\nSaturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough\\nof the enchantments to break through the rest.”\\n“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting\\nstrangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?”\\nOnce again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.\\n“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have – with difficulty, and\\nafter great effort – succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius\\nThicknesse.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n10\\nMany of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor,\\nDolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.\\n“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrim-\\ngeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on\\nthe Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”\\n“Yes – my Lord, that is true – but you know, as Head of the Department\\nof Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with\\nthe Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry\\ndepartments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking\\nofficial under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work\\ntogether to bring Scrimgeour down.”\\n“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has con-\\nverted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains unlikely that the\\nMinistry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at\\nhis destination, then it must be done while he travels.”\\n“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed\\ndetermined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several peo-\\nple planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates\\nor uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”\\n“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any form\\nof transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust\\neverything to do with the place.”\\n“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the open.\\nEasier to take, by far.”\\nAgain, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on,\\n“I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes\\nwhere Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That\\nPotter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.”\\nThe company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each\\nof them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry\\nPotter’s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n11\\nmore to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body\\nabove him.\\n“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance,\\nthose wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I\\nunderstand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one\\nto kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”\\nAt these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a\\nterrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked\\ndownward, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet.\\n“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone,\\nand without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not\\nspoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?”\\n“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had\\nbeen sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be\\nunoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room,\\nleaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.\\n“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces\\nof his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to\\nborrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.”\\nThe faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have\\nannounced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.\\n“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see... Lucius, I see no reason\\nfor you to have a wand anymore.”\\nLucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the\\nfirelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice\\nwas hoarse. “My Lord?”\\n“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”\\n“I...”\\nMalfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead,\\nquite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but\\nbeneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n12\\nMalfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it along to\\nVoldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.\\n“What is it?”\\n“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy. “And the core?”\\n“Dragon – dragon heartstring.”\\n“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared the\\nlengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a\\nsecond, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s wand in exchange for\\nhis own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened\\nmaliciously.\\n“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?” Some of the throng sniggered.\\n“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I\\nhave noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late What\\nis it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?”\\n“Nothing – nothing, my Lord!”\\n“Such lies, Lucius “\\nThe soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped\\nmoving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing\\ngrew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor\\nbeneath the table.\\nThe huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,\\nseemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its\\nneck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for\\npupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin\\nfingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.\\n“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my\\nrise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”\\n“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped\\nsweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it – we do.”\\nTo Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from\\nVoldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n13\\nup at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away\\nagain, terrified to make eye contact.\\n“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice con-\\nstricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s house.\\nThere can be no higher pleasure.”\\nShe sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and\\nheavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa\\nsat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words\\ncould not demonstrate her longing for closeness.\\n“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one\\nside as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from\\nyou.”\\nHer face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight. “My\\nLord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”\\n“No higher pleasure... even compared with the happy event that, I hear,\\nhas taken place in your family this week?”\\nShe stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. “I don’t know what\\nyou mean, my Lord.”\\n“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa.\\nShe has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.”\\nThere was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many\\nleaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with\\ntheir fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide\\nand hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they\\nat Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently\\nflushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.\\n“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of\\nmirth. “We – Narcissa and I – have never set eyes on our sister since she\\nmarried the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any\\nbeast she marries.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n14\\n“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was\\nquiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the\\ncubs?”\\nThe hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who\\nwas staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s eye. She shook\\nher head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the\\nopposite wall.\\n“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. “Enough.” And the\\nlaughter died at once.\\n“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he\\nsaid as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring. “You must prune\\nyours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten\\nthe health of the rest.”\\n“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of\\ngratitude again. “At the first chance!”\\n“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in the\\nworld... we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the\\ntrue blood remain…”\\nVoldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly\\nrevolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure\\ncame to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds.\\n“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.\\nSnape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death Eaters\\nwere looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permi-\\nssion to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman\\nsaid in a cracked and terrified voice, “Severus! Help me!”\\n“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.\\n“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout with his\\nwand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had\\nwoken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n15\\n“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For those\\nof you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage\\nwho, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wiz-\\nardry.”\\nThere were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad,\\nhunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.\\n“Yes... Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all\\nabout Muggles... how they are not so different from us…”\\nOne of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to\\nface Snape again.\\n“Severus... please... please...”\\n“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand, and\\nCharity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting and polluting\\nthe minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an\\nimpassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says,\\nmust accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of\\nthe purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance...\\nShe would have us all mate with Muggles... or, no doubt, werewolves…”\\nNobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and con-\\ntempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved\\nto face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked\\nback at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again.\\n“Avada Kedavra.”\\nThe flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity\\nfell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and\\ncreaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell\\nout of his onto the floor.\\n“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and\\nslithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n16\\nCHAPTER TWO\\nIN MEMORIAM\\nH\\narry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing\\nunder his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch\\nof breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting\\non the floor outside his bedroom door. “What the –?”\\nHe looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was\\ndeserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap.\\nKeeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup\\ntogether with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin\\njust visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bath-\\nroom to run his finger under the tap.\\nIt was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days\\nleft of being unable to perform magic... but he had to admit to himself that\\nthis jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned\\nhow to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it – particularly in light\\nof his immediate plans – this seemed a serious flaw in his magical edu-\\ncation. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a\\nlarge wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before\\nreturning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n17\\nHarry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for\\nthe first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the inter-\\nvening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters\\nof the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general\\ndebris at the bottom – old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no\\nlonger fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch,\\nexperienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and with-\\ndrawn it to see a lot of blood.\\nHe now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the\\ntrunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old\\nbadge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and\\nPOTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket\\ninside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered\\nthe sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a\\ntwo-inchlong fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather,\\nSirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk\\nfor the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift except\\npowdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering\\ngrit.\\nHarry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself,\\nseeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he\\nplaced the fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, which lay\\nunread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter\\nmemories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken\\nmirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.\\nIt took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items,\\nand sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need\\nthem from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment,\\nquills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind.\\nHe wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the\\ndead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n18\\nHis Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books,\\nthe photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his\\nwand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the\\nMarauder’s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The\\nlocket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable – in all\\nusual senses it was worthless – but because of what it had cost to attain it.\\nThis left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his\\nsnowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet\\nDrive this summer.\\nHe got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig\\nmade no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing\\nthem onto the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else faking;\\nshe was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed\\nout of her cage at the moment.\\nAs he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down,\\nsearching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he\\nhad returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had\\nbeen a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage,\\nthe Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page\\nten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking\\nfor.\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED\\nby Elphias Doge\\nI met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven,\\non our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attract-\\nion was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both\\nfelt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted\\ndragon pox shortly before arriving at school,\\nand while I was no longer contagious, my pock-\\nmarked visage and greenish hue did not encou-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n19\\nrage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at\\nHogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a\\nyear previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a\\nsavage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles.\\nAlbus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die\\nin Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I\\nplucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his\\nfather to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of\\nthe sad business, though many attempted to make him do so.\\nSome, indeed, were disposed to praise his father’s action and\\nassumed that Albus too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have\\nbeen more mistaken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest,\\nhe never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his\\ndetermined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies\\nin subsequent years.\\nIn a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame had begun\\nto eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would\\nnever again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing\\nmore or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school.\\nThose of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from\\nhis example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with\\nwhich he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life\\nthat he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.\\nHe not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he\\nwas soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magi-\\ncal names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated\\nalchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert\\nWaffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found\\ntheir way into learned publications such as Transfiguration To-\\nday, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dum-\\nbledore’s future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n20\\nquestion that remained was when he would become Minister of\\nMagic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was\\non the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial\\nambitions.\\nThree years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus’s brother,\\nAberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was\\nnever bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by\\ndueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is\\nquite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not\\nfriends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different\\nboys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that\\nliving in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an altogether comfort-\\nable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational\\nhazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasur-\\nable as a brother.\\nWhen Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-\\ntraditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing\\nforeign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However,\\ntragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother,\\nKendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of\\nthe family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my\\nrespects at Kendra’s funeral, then left for what was now to be a\\nsolitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and\\nlittle gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of\\nAlbus accompanying me.\\nThat was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I\\nwrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of\\nmy journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the\\nexperiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little\\nof his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for\\nsuch a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n21\\nwith horror that I heard, toward the end of my year’s travels, that\\nyet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his\\nsister, Ariana.\\nThough Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the\\nblow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a pro-\\nfound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to Albus –\\nand I count myself one of that lucky number – agree that Ariana’s\\ndeath, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility for it\\n(though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him\\nforevermore.\\nI returned home to find a young man who had experienced a\\nmuch older person’s suffering. Albus was more reserved than\\nbefore, and much less lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss\\nof Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and\\nAberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift – in\\nlater years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then\\ncertainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents\\nor of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention\\nthem.\\nOther quills will describe the triumphs of the following years.\\nDumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the store of Wizard-\\ning knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dra-\\ngon’s blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom\\nhe displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief War-\\nlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel\\never matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945.\\nThose who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they\\nfelt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle.\\nDumbledore’s triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding\\nworld, are considered a turning point in magical history to match\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n22\\nthe introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the\\ndownfall of He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed.\\nAlbus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find\\nsomething to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant\\nor wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with\\ngreat humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more\\nthan I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizard-\\ning world’s. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of\\nall Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he\\nlived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour,\\nas willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as\\nhe was on the day that I met him.\\nHarry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying\\nthe obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he\\npeered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression,\\neven in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense\\nof humiliation.\\nHe had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading\\nthis obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him\\nat all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was\\nas though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and\\nsilver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd,\\nlike trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.\\nHe had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it\\nwould have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common\\nknowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with\\nGrindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had\\nbeen like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had\\nalways discussed Harry, Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans... and it\\nseemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n23\\nso uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had\\nfailed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only\\npersonal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one\\nhe suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly:\\n“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”\\n“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”\\nAfter several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet,\\nfolded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical\\nDefensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest\\nof the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was\\nmuch tidier. The only things left out of place were today’s Daily Prophet,\\nstill lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.\\nHarry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s\\nProphet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline\\nwhen he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that\\nmorning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about\\nVoldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to\\nsuppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw\\nwhat he had missed.\\nAcross the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over\\na picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:\\nDUMBLEDORE – THE TRUTH AT LAST?\\nComing next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius\\nconsidered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation.\\nStripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded\\nwisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless\\nyouth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore\\ncarried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of\\nMagic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n24\\npurpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the\\nPhoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?\\nThe answers to these and many more questions are explored in\\nthe explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus\\nDumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty\\nBraithwaite, page 13, inside.\\nHarry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was\\ntopped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing\\njeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what\\nwas clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him.\\nDoing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on.\\nIn person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her\\nfamously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in\\nthe hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the\\nkitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without\\nsaying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.\\n“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says\\nSkeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure my book will be the first\\nof very, very many.”\\nSkeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-\\npage book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumbledore’s\\nmysterious death in June. I ask her how she managed this super-\\nfast feat.\\n“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as I have, working\\nto a deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world\\nwas clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to\\nmeet that need.”\\nI mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias\\nDoge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n25\\nfriend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less\\nfact than a Chocolate Frog card.”\\nSkeeter throws back her head and laughs.\\n“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years\\nback about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed\\nto think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept\\ntelling me to watch out for trout.”\\nAnd yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy have been\\nechoed in many places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short\\nweeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s\\nlong and extraordinary life?\\n“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately ac-\\nross the knuckles, “you know as well as I do how much informa-\\ntion can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear\\nthe word ‘no,’ and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were\\nqueuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone\\nthought he was so wonderful, you know – he trod on an awful lot\\nof important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high\\nhippogriff, because I’ve had access to a source most journalists\\nwould swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public\\nbefore and who was close to Dumbledore during the most turbu-\\nlent and disturbing phase of his youth.”\\nThe advance publicity for Skeeter’s biography has certainly\\nsuggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe\\nDumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest\\nsurprises she uncovered, I ask?\\n“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all the highlights\\nbefore anybody’s bought the book!” laughs Skeeter. “But I can\\npromise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as\\nhis beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody\\nhearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n26\\nthat he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a\\nwizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t\\nexactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dum-\\nbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very\\nfishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.”\\nI ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s brother,\\nAberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of\\nmagic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago.\\n“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,” laughs Skeeter.\\n“No, no, I’m talking about much worse than a brother with a fond-\\nness for fiddling about with goats, worse even than the Muggle-\\nmaiming father – Dumbledore couldn’t keep either of them quiet\\nanyway, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it’s the\\nmother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging unco-\\nvered a positive nest of nastiness – but, as I say, you’ll have to\\nwait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now\\nis, it’s no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose\\ngot broken.”\\nFamily skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilli-\\nance that led to Dumbledore’s many magical discoveries?\\n“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many now question\\nwhether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed\\nachievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby\\nclaims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood\\nwhen Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”\\nBut the importance of some of Dumbledore’s achievements\\ncannot, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grin-\\ndelwald?\\n“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says Skeeter\\nwith a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over\\nDumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n27\\nbombshell – or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed.\\nAll I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular\\nduel of legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced\\nto conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handker-\\nchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!”\\nSkeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing sub-\\nject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly\\nfascinate her readers more than any other.\\n“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an entire\\nchapter to the whole Potter–Dumbledore relationship. It’s been\\ncalled unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to\\nbuy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that\\nDumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word\\ngo. Whether that was really in the boy’s best interests – well, we’ll\\nsee. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most\\ntroubled adolescence.”\\nI ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom\\nshe so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in\\nwhich Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-\\nWho had returned.\\n“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor\\nPotter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing\\nmoments of his life – the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably\\none of the only people alive who can say that they know the real\\nHarry Potter.”\\nWhich leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about\\nDumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was\\nthere when Dumbledore died?\\n“Well, I don’t want to say too much – it’s all in the book – but\\neyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away\\nfrom the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n28\\npushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man\\nagainst whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it\\nseems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide – once\\nthey’ve read my book.”\\nOn that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt\\nthat Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore’s\\nlegions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is\\nsoon to emerge about their hero.\\nHarry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at\\nthe page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the\\nnewspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the\\nrest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin.\\nHe began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and\\npicking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious\\nof what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article echoed in his\\nhead: An entire chapter to the whole Potter–Dumbledore relationship... It’s\\nbeen called unhealthy, even sinister He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in\\nhis youth... I’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their\\nwands for...\\n“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door\\nneighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously.\\nHarry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away\\nfrom him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking\\nof Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him...\\nA flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged\\nedge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced\\nover his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia’s\\nchoosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. He peered\\ninto the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green\\neye looking back at him.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n29\\nHe had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because\\nhe had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was\\nthat the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him\\nagain.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n30\\nCHAPTER THREE\\nTHE DURSLEYS DEPARTING\\nT\\nhe sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice\\nyelled, “Oi! You!”\\nSixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his\\nuncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was\\nstill gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had\\nthought he saw Dumbledore’s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed,\\n“BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door,\\npausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things\\nhe would be taking with him.\\n“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at\\nthe top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”\\nHarry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. When he\\nreached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for\\ntraveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat\\nsalmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in\\nhis leather jacket.\\n“Yes?” asked Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n31\\n“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. “Please!”\\nadded Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his\\nthroat.\\nHarry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace\\nup and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with\\nanxious expressions. Finally, his large purple face crumpled with concen-\\ntration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke.\\n“I’ve changed my mind,” he said. “What a surprise,” said Harry.\\n“Don’t you take that tone –” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but\\nVernon Dursley waved her down.\\n“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy\\nlittle eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re staying put,\\nwe’re not going anywhere.”\\nHarry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and\\namusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four\\nhours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car\\nwith every change of heart. Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when\\nUncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case\\nsince the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into\\nthe boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.\\n“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up\\nand down the living room, “we – Petunia, Dudley, and I – are in danger.\\nFrom – from –”\\n“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.\\n“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in\\nfront of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I\\nbelieve it’s a plot to get the house.”\\n“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”\\n“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to\\npulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n32\\nus out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and\\nbefore we know it the deeds will be in your name and –”\\n“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?\\nAre you actually as stupid as you look?”\\n“Don’t you dare –!” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her\\ndown: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the\\ndanger he had spotted.\\n“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a house, my\\ngodfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memo-\\nries?”\\nThere was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with\\nthis argument.\\n“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this\\nLord Thing –”\\n“– Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through this\\nabout a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dumbledore told\\nyou last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley –”\\nVernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that\\nhis uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit,\\na few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The\\narrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had\\ncome as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, how-\\never, that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his\\nreappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.\\n“– Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on\\nremorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me\\nsafe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure\\nVoldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where\\nI am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue\\nyou.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n33\\nUncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant\\nthey were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on\\nand Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to\\nhelp. You’re being offered serious protection, the best there is.”\\nUncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside\\nthe sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door neighbor’s lawn\\nmower stalled again.\\n“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley\\nabruptly.\\n“There is,” said Harry, surprised.\\n“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent\\nvictims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to\\nqualify for government protection!”\\nHarry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his\\nuncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he\\ndespised and mistrusted.\\n“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied. “We\\nthink the Ministry has been infiltrated.”\\nUncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that\\nhis great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration.\\n“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All right, let’s\\nsay, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don’t see why\\nwe can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”\\nHarry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had\\nalso been addressed half a dozen times.\\n“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, “Kingsley is protecting\\nthe Mug – I mean, your Prime Minister.”\\n“Exactly – he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank tele-\\nvision screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking\\nalong discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital.\\nThis, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n34\\nMuggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep\\nvoice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had\\ncertainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had\\nnever seen him with his earring in.\\n“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are\\nmore than up to the job –”\\n“If we’d even seen CVs...” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience.\\nGetting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set\\nhimself.\\n“These accidents aren’t accidents – the crashes and explosions and\\nderailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the\\nnews. People are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it – Voldemort.\\nI’ve told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the\\nfogs – they’re caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they\\nare, ask your son!”\\nDudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and\\nHarry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There\\nare... more of them?”\\n“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean?\\nOf course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time,\\nseeing as they feed off fear and despair –”\\n“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your\\npoint–”\\n“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them – Death\\nEaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi – which means dead bodies enchanted\\nby a Dark wizard – will be able to find you and will certainly attack you.\\nAnd if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll\\nagree you need help.”\\nThere was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing\\ndown a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening\\nyears. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n35\\nHarry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work? What\\nabout Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of\\nlayabout wizards –”\\n“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and kill you\\nlike they did my parents!”\\n“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad – I’m going with these Order\\npeople.”\\n“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re talking\\nsense.” He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough\\nto accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany him: There could\\nbe no question of being separated from their Diddykins. Harry glanced at\\nthe carriage clock on the mantelpiece.\\n“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none of the\\nDursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of parting – probably for-\\never – from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contem-\\nplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in\\nthe air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid\\ndislike?\\nBack in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then\\npoked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage. They fell\\nwith dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.\\n“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll be\\nable to fly again.”\\nThe doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and\\ndownstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the\\nDursleys on their own.\\n“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened\\nthe door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow.\\n“An honor, as ever!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n36\\n“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile\\nupon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of you to do this... They’re\\nthrough here, my aunt and uncle and cousin…”\\n“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily, strid-\\ning into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addre-\\nssed thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank\\nnearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard.\\n“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told\\nyou, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out\\nof his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be leaving before Harry does.\\nDue to the danger of using magic in your house – Harry being still underage,\\nit could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him – we shall be\\ndriving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we\\nhave picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle\\nVernon politely.\\n“Know how to –? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered\\nUncle Vernon.\\n“Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be utterly\\nbamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus. He was clearly\\nunder the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visi-\\nbly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.\\n“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling\\nindignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him.\\n“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard. There\\nhas been a little change in the arrangements –”\\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye was going\\nto come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”\\n“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”\\nThe Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incompre-\\nhension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry up!” Harry\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n37\\nlooked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from\\nDedalus’s pocket watch.\\n“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus,\\nnodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. “We are attem-\\npting to time your departure from the house with your family’s Disappa-\\nrition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the moment you all head for safety.”\\nHe turned to the Dursleys. “Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”\\nNone of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at\\nthe bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.\\n“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia.\\nShe clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while\\nHarry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells.\\n“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further\\nexplanation unnecessary by saying loudly, “Well, this is good-bye, then,\\nboy.”\\nHe swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the last\\nmoment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began\\nswinging it backward and forward like a metronome.\\n“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her\\nhandbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.\\nDudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar,\\nreminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.\\n“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.\\nHe had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, “I\\ndon’t understand.”\\n“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at\\nher son.\\nDudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. “Why isn’t he\\ncoming with us?”\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley\\nas though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n38\\n“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.\\n“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.\\n“Well, he – he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at\\nHarry and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?”\\n“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.\\n“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on, we’re off.”\\nHe marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley\\ndid not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.\\n“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.\\nIt seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put\\ninto words. After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle\\nhe said, “But where’s he going to go?”\\nAunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that\\nDudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence.\\n“But... surely you know where your nephew is going?” she asked, look-\\ning bewildered.\\n“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some of your\\nlot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in\\na hurry.”\\nAgain, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did\\nnot follow.\\n“Off with some of our lot?”\\nHestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before: Witches and\\nwizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest\\nin the famous Harry Potter.\\n“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”\\n“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. “Don’t\\nthese people realize what you’ve been through? What danger you are in?\\nThe unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort move-\\nment?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n39\\n“Er – no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a waste of space,\\nactually, but I’m used to –”\\n“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”\\nIf Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have believed it.\\nAs it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it\\nmust have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had\\nturned red. Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself.\\n“Well... er... thanks, Dudley.”\\nAgain, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for\\nexpression before mumbling, “You saved my life.”\\n“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would have\\ntaken…”\\nHe looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact\\nduring this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so\\nbriefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however,\\nthat the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not\\nhave been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless\\nquite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express\\nhis feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided\\ninto scarlet-faced silence.\\nAunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look\\nthat changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley\\nrather than Harry.\\n“S-so sweet, Dudders...” she sobbed into his massive chest. “S-such a\\nlovely b-boy... s-saying thank you...”\\n“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He only\\nsaid he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”\\n“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’” said Harry, torn\\nbetween annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to\\nclutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n40\\n“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at\\nthe living room door. “I thought we were on a tight schedule!”\\n“Yes – yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these\\nexchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself\\ntogether. “We really must be off. Harry –”\\nHe tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his own.\\n“– good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world\\nrest upon your shoulders.”\\n“Oh,” said Harry, “right. Thanks.”\\n“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our thoughts go\\nwith you.”\\n“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia\\nand Dudley.\\n“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle brightly,\\nwaving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.\\nDudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked\\ntoward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then\\nDudley held out his large, pink hand.\\n“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, “did\\nthe dementors blow a different personality into you?”\\n“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”\\n“Yeah...” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it. “Maybe. Take\\ncare, Big D.”\\nDudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his\\nheavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.\\nAunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked\\naround at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone\\nwith Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said,\\n“Well – good-bye,” and marched toward the door without looking at him.\\n“Good-bye,” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n41\\nShe stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest\\nfeeling that she wanted to say something to him: She gave him an odd,\\ntremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a\\nlittle jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n42\\nCHAPTER FOUR\\nTHE SEVEN POTTERS\\nH\\narry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in\\ntime to see the Dursleys’ car swinging out of the drive and off up the road.\\nDedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the\\nbackseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned\\nscarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.\\nHarry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his\\nunnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his\\nungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broom-\\nstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now,\\nthe hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand\\nhere in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the\\nlast time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went\\nout to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing\\nonly to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play\\non Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the\\nchannels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remem-\\nber those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had\\nlost.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n43\\n“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig, who\\nwas still sulking with her head under her wing. “We’ll never be here again.\\nDon’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this\\ndoormat. What memories... Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the\\ndementors... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it?...\\nAnd last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door…”\\nHarry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did\\nnothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her\\nwing. Harry turned his back on the front door.\\n“And under here, Hedwig” – Harry pulled open a door under the stairs –\\n“is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then – Blimey, it’s small, I’d\\nforgotten…”\\nHarry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering\\nhow he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the\\nstaircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two.\\nThose had been the days before he had known anything about his true\\nidentity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such\\nstrange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember\\nthe dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams\\ninvolving flashes of green light and once – Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed\\nthe car when Harry had recounted it – a flying motorbike...\\nThere was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry\\nstraightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door\\nframe. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear\\nwords, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring\\nout of the window into the back garden.\\nThe darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by\\none, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted.\\nDominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting\\nastride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n44\\nhim other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal,\\nblack winged horses.\\nWrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was\\na general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron\\nclapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All righ’, Harry? Ready fer the\\noff?”\\n“Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I wasn’t\\nexpecting this many of you!”\\n“Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous,\\nbulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to\\nhouse to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get undercover before we talk\\nyou through it.”\\nHarry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering,\\nthey settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work\\nsurfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky;\\nHermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinn-\\ning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-\\nfaced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-\\nlegged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose\\nshort hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined;\\nFleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley,\\nbald, black, broadshouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing\\nhunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus\\nFletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset hound’s eyes\\nand matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He\\nfelt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to\\nstrangle the last time they had met.\\n“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?”\\nhe called across the room.\\n“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley. “You’re\\nmore important.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n45\\n“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing\\nmachine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.\\n“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. “I’m sorry\\nyou couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”\\n“That’s brilliant, congrat –”\\n“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later!” roared\\nMoody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his\\nsacks at his feet and turned to Harry. “As Dedalus probably told you, we\\nhad to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a\\nbig problem. He’s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to\\nthe Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in\\nthe name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you.\\nAbsolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already.\\nWhat he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.\\n“Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the\\nTrace on you.”\\n“I don’t –”\\n“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm that\\ndetects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry\\nfinds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell\\nto get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the\\nDeath Eaters.\\n“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn\\nseventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius\\nThicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper.”\\nHarry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. “So what\\nare we going to do?”\\n“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones\\nthe Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them:\\nbrooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n46\\nHarry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give\\nMad-Eye the chance to address them.\\n“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when\\nyou come of age, or” – Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen – “you\\nno longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your\\nseparate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never going to\\nlive together again, correct?”\\nHarry nodded.\\n“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm\\nwill break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choosing to break it\\nearly, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and\\nseize you the moment you turn seventeen.\\n“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn’t\\nknow we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry:\\nThey think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-\\nKnowWho we’re dealing with, so we can’t just rely on him getting the date\\nwrong; he’s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in\\nthis general area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses\\nevery protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the\\nplace we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the\\nOrder: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s – you get the\\nidea.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a\\ngaping hole in the plan.\\n“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries\\nof the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to\\nuse a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”\\n“Er – yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve\\nsecure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once”\\n– he performed a quick headcount – “fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s\\nparents’?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n47\\n“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us\\nwon’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters\\nmoving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair\\nheading for a different safe house.”\\nFrom inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like\\nmud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the\\nrest of the plan immediately.\\n“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No way!”\\n“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint of comp-\\nlacency.\\n“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives –!”\\n“– because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.\\n“This is different, pretending to be me –”\\n“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly. “Imagine if\\nsomething went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.”\\nHarry did not smile.\\n“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.”\\n“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously there’s no\\nchance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.”\\n“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic;\\nwe’ve got no chance,” said Fred.\\n“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”\\n“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his magical eye\\nnow quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. “Everyone here’s\\noverage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.”\\nMundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways\\nto glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.\\n“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few of your\\nhairs, boy, now.”\\n“But this is mad, there’s no need –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n48\\n“No need!” snarled Moody. “With You-Know-Who out there and half\\nthe Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swallowed the\\nfake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he’d be\\nmad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do.\\nThey might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s\\ncharm holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the\\nplace. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split\\nhimself into seven.”\\nHarry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once. “So, Potter –\\nsome of your hair, if you please.”\\nHarry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.\\n“Now!” barked Moody.\\nWith all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head,\\ngrabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.\\n“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the\\nflask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”\\nHarry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made\\ncontact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at\\nonce, it turned a clear, bright gold.\\n“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said Her-\\nmione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly,\\nand saying, “Oh, you know what I mean – Goyle’s potion looked like\\nbogies.”\\n“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody.\\nRon, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt\\nPetunia’s gleaming sink.\\n“We’re one short,” said Lupin.\\n“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the\\nneck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly\\nand moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.\\n“I’ve toldjer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n49\\n“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless\\nworm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not\\nkill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish\\nPotter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry\\nabout, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.”\\nMundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already\\npulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he\\nhanded out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one.\\n“Altogether, then...”\\nRon, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them\\ngasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats: At once, their features\\nbegan to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were\\nshooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was\\ndarkening, Hermione’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their\\nskulls.\\nMoody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks\\nhe had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six\\nHarry Potters gasping and panting in front of him.\\nFred and George turned to each other and said together, “Wow – we’re\\nidentical!”\\n“I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,” said Fred, examining\\nhis reflection in the kettle.\\n“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, don’t\\nlook at me – I’m ‘ideous.”\\n“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said\\nMoody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses,\\nthere’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s lugg-\\nage in the other sack.”\\nThe real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he\\nhad ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as\\nhis six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n50\\nputting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them\\nto show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off\\nwith impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they\\nwould have been with their own.\\n“I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, looking down at\\nhis bare chest.\\n“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she put on\\nglasses.\\nOnce dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each con-\\ntaining a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.\\n“Good,” said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and lugga-\\ngeladen Harrys faced him. “The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will\\nbe traveling with me, by broom –”\\n“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.\\n“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody, and sure\\nenough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued,\\n“Arthur and Fred –”\\n“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. “Can’t you\\neven tell us apart when we’re Harry?”\\n“Sorry, George –”\\n“I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really –”\\n“Enough messing around!” snarled Moody. “The other one – George or\\nFred or whoever you are – you’re with Remus. Miss Delacour –”\\n“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond of\\nbrooms.”\\nFleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look\\nthat Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.\\n“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral –”\\nHermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry\\nknew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n51\\n“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a\\nmug tree as she waved at him.\\nRon did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.\\n“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a little\\nanxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight,\\nsee. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the\\nsidecar.”\\n“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.\\n“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said\\nMoody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s had plenty\\nof time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so\\nif we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the\\nPotters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,” he went on, tying\\nup the sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to\\nthe door, “I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point\\nlocking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come\\nlooking... Come on…”\\nHarry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s\\ncage before joining the others in the dark back garden. On every side broom-\\nsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto\\na great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was\\nstanding ready beside the motorbike, goggles on.\\n“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”\\n“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’ the last time\\nyeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!”\\nHarry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar.\\nIt placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight\\nof him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack\\nand broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his\\nknees. It was extremely uncomfortable.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n52\\n“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry’s\\ndiscomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slight-\\nly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a few tricks up its handlebars\\nnow. Tha’ one was my idea.”\\nHe pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.\\n“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside\\nthem, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure that was advisable and it’s\\ncertainly only to be used in emergencies.”\\n“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; I want us all to\\nleave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion’s lost.”\\nEverybody mounted their brooms.\\n“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive,\\nguilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist.\\nHagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, and the\\nsidecar began to vibrate.\\n“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody. “See you all in about an hour at\\nthe Burrow. On the count of three. One... two THREE.”\\nThere was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give\\na nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly,\\nhair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward\\ntoo; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed into the\\nsidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting\\nto go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last\\nglimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge\\nof the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and higher\\nthey climbed into the sky –\\nAnd then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least\\nthirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst\\nof which the Order members had risen, oblivious –\\nScreams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the\\nmotorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n53\\nabove him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life.\\nHedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his\\nknees –\\n“No – HEDWIG!”\\nThe broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of\\nhis rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way\\nup again. A second’s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl\\nscreeched and fell to the floor of the cage.\\n“No – NO!”\\nThe motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters\\nscattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.\\n“Hedwig – Hedwig –”\\nBut the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage.\\nHe could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He\\nglanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green\\nlight, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he\\ncould not tell who they were –\\n“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled over the\\nthunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig’s\\ncage onto the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. “Hagrid, TURN\\nAROUND!”\\n“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and he opened\\nthe throttle.\\n“Stop – STOP!” Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of\\ngreen light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from\\nthe circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid\\nswerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses\\nshot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them.\\nWriggling around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his\\nown wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they\\nscattered to avoid it.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n54\\n“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ‘em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up\\njust in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near\\nthe fuel gauge.\\nA wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his\\nneck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters\\nswerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: He vanished from\\nview and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken\\ninto pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the\\nairborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the\\nhandlebars and sped up.\\nMore Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the two remaining\\nDeath Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with\\nfurther Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of\\nmulticolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the\\nMuggles below who would have no idea what was happening –\\n“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a\\nsecond button. This time a great net burst from the bike’s exhaust, but the\\nDeath Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the\\ncompanion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up.\\nHe bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were\\npursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it.\\n“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him\\nslam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.\\nWith an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust,\\nwhite-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a\\nsound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight\\nto avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway\\nominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force\\nof acceleration.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n55\\n“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto his back\\nby the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting\\nto twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.\\n“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket\\npocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella.\\n“Hagrid! No! Let me!”\\n“REPARO!”\\nThere was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike\\ncompletely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike’s\\nflight, then the sidecar began to lose height –\\nIn desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, “Win-\\ngardium Leviosa!”\\nThe sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: He had\\nbut a split second’s relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The\\nthree Death Eaters were closing in.\\n“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry\\ncould feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could,\\nhe pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, “Impedi-\\nmenta!” The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the\\nman was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible\\nbarrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him –\\nThen the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater\\nshot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car,\\nknocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat –\\n“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!”\\nA huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him out of the\\nplummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged\\nhimself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to-back with\\nHagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters,\\nHarry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar,\\nand yelled, “Confringo!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n56\\nHe knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the\\nDeath Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his\\ncompanion fell back and vanished.\\n“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta tried ter\\nrepair it meself – yeh’ve got no room –”\\n“It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted back, as two more\\nDeath Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.\\nAs the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid\\nswerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dra-\\ngonfire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning\\nSpell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off.\\nHe shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to\\navoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell,\\nHarry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike – Stan –\\n“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled.\\n“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”\\nThe hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the thunder\\nof the motorbike’s engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and\\ndisappeared from view.\\n“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid. “Where’ve they gone?”\\n“I don’t know!”\\nBut Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real\\none!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty dark-\\nness and felt its menace. Where were they?\\nHe clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the\\nback of Hagrid’s jacket.\\n“Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!”\\n“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”\\nThere was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot\\nfrom the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off what little of the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n57\\nseat he had, Hagrid flung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip\\non the handlebars –\\n“I think we’ve lost ‘em Harry, I think we’ve done it!” yelled Hagrid.\\nBut Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked left and\\nright for pursuers he was sure would come... Why had they fallen back? One\\nof them had still had a wand... It’s him... it’s the real one They had said it\\nright after he had tried to Disarm Stan...\\n“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted Hagrid.\\nHarry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still\\nseemed remote as stars.\\nThen the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared\\non either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters,\\ncast from behind –\\nAnd then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind,\\nwithout broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out\\nof the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again –\\nHagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical\\ndive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random\\ninto the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one\\nof them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the\\nmotorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control –\\nGreen jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way\\nwas up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any\\nsecond. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise\\nits arm –\\n“NO!”\\nWith a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death\\nEater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out\\nof sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick –\\nBarely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard\\nVoldemort scream, “Mine!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n58\\nIt was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed\\nanother Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, “Avada –”\\nAs the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its\\nown accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a\\nspurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a\\nscream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed,\\n“No!”: Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button.\\nHe punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into\\nthe air, hurtling straight toward the ground.\\n“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. “Hagrid –\\nAccio Hagrid!”\\nThe motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the\\nhandlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and\\nnearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it.\\nBehind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your\\nwand!” He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared\\ninto the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw:\\nVoldemort preparing to curse him once more –\\nAnd then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid\\nspread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to\\navoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground-\\ntrembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n59\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\nFALLEN WARRIOR\\n“H\\nagrid?”\\nHarry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that\\nsurrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to\\nstand. He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected\\nhim to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet\\nwas trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the\\npond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was\\nHagrid.\\n“Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me –” But the dark mass did not stir.\\n“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?”\\nHarry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman shouted,\\n“They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!”\\nHarry’s head was swimming.\\n“Hagrid,” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.\\nThe next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like\\ncushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing\\ntooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.\\n“Hagrid?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n60\\nHe opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar,\\nlamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away,\\nwet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxi-\\nously.\\n“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now. How\\nare you feeling? Anything else broken? I’ve fixed your ribs, your tooth, and\\nyour arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks – Dora’s father.”\\nHarry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt\\nsick and giddy.\\n“Voldemort –”\\n“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder and\\npushing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty crash you just\\nhad. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur\\nWeasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?”\\n“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death Eaters,\\nloads of them – we were chased –”\\n“Death Eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, Death Eaters? I\\nthought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight, I thought –”\\n“They knew,” said Harry.\\nTed Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to\\nthe sky above.\\n“Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we? They shoul-\\ndn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.”\\nNow Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the\\npoint when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order’s charms. He only\\nhoped they would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred\\nyards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what Harry\\nvisualized as a great transparent bubble.\\nHe swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes\\nbefore he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n61\\nwhen a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in\\nmud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive.\\n“Harry!”\\nKnocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor\\nbetween them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked\\nhis newly repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that? I\\nthought we were both goners.”\\n“Yeah, me too. I can’t believe –”\\nHarry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the\\nroom behind Hagrid.\\n“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was\\nempty.\\n“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm. “It fell\\nright beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.”\\n“Oh, I’m – I’m sorry.”\\nAs she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance to her\\nsister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft\\nbrown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little\\nhaughty after Harry’s exclamation.\\n“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said you were\\nambushed; where is Nymphadora?”\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to anyone\\nelse.”\\nShe and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry\\nat the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his\\nfault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair...\\n“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve got to get\\nback to the Burrow and find out – then we’ll be able to send you word, or –\\nor Tonks will, once she’s –”\\n“Dora’ll be okay, ‘Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff, she’s been\\nin plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey’s through here,” he\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n62\\nadded to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take\\nit.”\\n“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his\\nshoulders. “I –”\\nHe looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in\\nwhich he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words\\noccurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere.\\n“I’ll tell Tonks – Dora – to send word, when she Thanks for patching us\\nup, thanks for everything. I –”\\nHe was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short\\nhallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid\\nhitting his head on the door lintel.\\n“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.”\\nMr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the\\ndressing table.\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave.\\n“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s Hedwig?”\\n“She... she got hit,” said Harry.\\nThe realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears\\nstung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the\\nmagical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.\\nHagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder.\\n“Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a great old life –”\\n“Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue,\\nand Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.\\nWith a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had\\ndragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncon-\\ntrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from\\nMr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet slammed onto hard ground and he\\nfell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams.\\nThrowing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n63\\nslightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the\\nback door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered labo-\\nriously to his feet.\\n“Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?”\\ncried Mrs. Weasley.\\n“What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted. The answer\\nwas clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley’s pale face.\\n“The Death Eaters were waiting for us,” Harry told her. “We were surr-\\nounded the moment we took off – they knew it was tonight – I don’t know\\nwhat happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we could\\ndo to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us –”\\nHe could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to\\nunderstand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but –\\n“Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling him into a hug he did\\nnot feel he deserved.\\n“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a little shakily.\\n“Fer medicinal purposes?”\\nShe could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward\\nthe crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned\\nto Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once.\\n“Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Port-\\nkey, it came back without them,” she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying\\non the ground nearby. “And that one,” she pointed at an ancient sneaker,\\n“should have been Dad and Fred’s, they were supposed to be second. You\\nand Hagrid were third and,” she checked her watch, “if they made it, George\\nand Lupin ought to be back in about a minute.”\\nMrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed\\nto Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.\\n“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.\\nA blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter,\\nand Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n64\\nimmediately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting Geor-\\nge, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.\\nHarry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and Lupin\\ncarried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room,\\nwhere they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George’s head,\\nGinny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was\\nmissing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly\\nscarlet blood.\\nNo sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry\\nby the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen,\\nwhere Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.\\n“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!” Lupin\\nignored him.\\n“What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my\\noffice at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake. “Answer me!”\\n“A – a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?”\\nLupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. “Wha’\\nwas tha’ about?” roared Hagrid.\\n“I’m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,” said Lupin tersely. “We’ve been\\nbetrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only\\npeople who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You\\nmight have been an impostor.”\\n“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling to fit\\nthrough the door.\\n“You’re half-giant,” said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice\\nPotion is designed for human use only.”\\n“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving\\ntonight,” said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it\\nof any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he\\ndidn’t know which one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan\\nhe’d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n65\\n“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened?\\nHow did you escape?”\\nHarry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed\\nto recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how\\nthey must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and\\nHagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.\\n“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”\\n“I...” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of\\npanic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike... You know, the bloke who was\\nthe conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of –\\nwell, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!”\\nLupin looked aghast.\\n“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture\\nand kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”\\n“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned him\\nand he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!\\nExpelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added\\ndefiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias\\nSmith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army\\nhow to Disarm.\\n“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of\\nDeath Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very\\nunusual move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in\\nfront of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion\\nwas close to suicidal!”\\n“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.\\n“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters – frankly, most people!\\n– would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,\\nHarry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I\\nurge you not to let it become so!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n66\\nLupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of\\ndefiance inside him.\\n“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said\\nHarry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.”\\nLupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,\\nHagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring\\nhis mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.\\n“Will George be okay?”\\nAll Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question.\\n“I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing his ear, not when it’s\\nbeen cursed off –”\\nThere was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry\\nleapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.\\nTwo figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he\\nrealized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and\\nKingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung herself into\\nHarry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them.\\nOver Hermione’s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at\\nLupin’s chest.\\n“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?”\\n“‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,’” said Lupin calmly.\\nKingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, “It’s him, I’ve che-\\ncked!”\\n“All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his\\ncloak. “But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!”\\n“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize that\\nthere would be seven Harrys.”\\n“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?”\\n“Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.”\\nHermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. “What happened to you?”\\nLupin asked Kingsley.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n67\\n“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley reeled\\noff, “and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway\\nthrough but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can –”\\n“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.”\\n“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t under-\\nstand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?”\\n“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said Lupin. “Stan?”\\nrepeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?” Kingsley let out a\\nmirthless laugh.\\n“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry\\nhas hushed up. Travers’s hood fell off when I cursed him, he’s supposed to\\nbe inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where’s George?”\\n“He lost an ear,” said Lupin.\\n“Lost an –?” repeated Hermione in a high voice. “Snape’s work,” said\\nLupin.\\n“Snape?” shouted Harry. “You didn’t say –”\\n“He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a\\nspeciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in kind, but it\\nwas all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was\\nlosing so much blood.”\\nSilence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There\\nwas no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent,\\nunobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr.\\nWeasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus?\\n“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which\\nhe was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, then\\nheaded through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where\\nMrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had\\nstaunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping\\nhole where George’s ear had been.\\n“How is he?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n68\\nMrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow back, not\\nwhen it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much\\nworse He’s alive.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.”\\n“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked. “Hermione and\\nKingsley,” said Harry.\\n“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry\\nwanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs.\\nWeasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great\\ncrash from the kitchen.\\n“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if\\nyou know what’s good for you!”\\nHarry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into\\nthe living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew,\\nFred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.\\n“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!”\\n“How is he?”\\nMr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since\\nHarry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the\\nback of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not believe what he was\\nseeing.\\nPerhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival, George\\nstirred.\\n“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley. George’s fingers\\ngroped for the side of his head. “Saintlike,” he murmured.\\n“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking terrified. “Is his mind\\naffected?”\\n“Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his\\nbrother. “You see... I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?”\\nMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred’s pale face.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n69\\n“Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-\\nrelated humor before you, you go for holey?”\\n“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. “You’ll be\\nable to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.”\\nHe looked around.\\n“Hi, Harry – you are Harry, right?”\\n“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.\\n“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George. “Why aren’t Ron and\\nBill huddled round my sickbed?”\\n“They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George’s grin faded.\\nHarry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back\\noutside. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice,\\n“Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn’t have a long journey;\\nAuntie Muriel’s not that far from here.”\\nHarry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since\\nreaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his\\nskin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the\\nback steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.\\nKingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky\\nevery time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the liv-\\ning room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder\\nto shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when\\nHarry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.\\nThe minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The\\nslightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering\\nbush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap\\nunscathed from its leaves –\\nAnd then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward\\nthe ground –\\n“It’s them!” screamed Hermione.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n70\\nTonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.\\n“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s arms.\\nHis face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped daz-\\nedly toward Harry and Hermione.\\n“You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged\\nhim tightly.\\n“I thought – I thought –”\\n“‘M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “‘M fine.”\\n“Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin.\\n“Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when\\nyou’re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom –”\\n“You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around\\nhis neck.\\n“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking free.\\n“Are we the last back?”\\n“No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye\\nand Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum and Dad you’re okay, Ron –”\\nShe ran back inside.\\n“So what kept you? What happened?” Lupin sounded almost angry at\\nTonks.\\n“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry,\\nRemus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I’d got her, I owe Bellatrix.\\nBut we definitely injured Rodolphus... Then we got to Ron’s Auntie Muri-\\nel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us –”\\nA muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to\\nsay anything else.\\n“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Her-\\nmione, and Kingsley.\\nThey recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the\\ncontinued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie\\nupon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n71\\n“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been\\nthere an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the\\nsky. “Let me know when they’re back.”\\nLupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the\\ndarkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kings-\\nley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s boundaries.\\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind\\nthem. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks.\\n“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.”\\n“Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once. “How’s George?” asked\\nLupin.\\n“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron. “He’s lost –”\\nBut the end of Mrs. Weasley’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry:\\nA thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill\\nand Fleur slid from its back, windswept but unhurt.\\n“Bill! Thank God, thank God –”\\nMrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was per-\\nfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s dead.”\\nNobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside\\nhim was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.\\n“We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks\\nin the light from the kitchen window. “It happened just after we broke out\\nof the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north\\ntoo.\\nVoldemort – he can fly – went straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard\\nhim cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort’s\\ncurse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and –\\nthere was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our\\nown tail –”\\nBill’s voice broke.\\n“Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said Lupin.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n72\\nThey all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend\\nit. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the con-\\nsummate survivor...\\nAt last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there\\nwas no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where\\nFred and George were laughing together.\\n“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered. “What’s\\nhappened? Who’s –?”\\n“Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.”\\nThe twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know\\nwhat to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been\\nclose to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his protégée at the Ministry\\nof Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had\\nmost space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.\\nBill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of firewhisky\\nand some glasses.\\n“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses\\nsoaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft.\\n“MadEye.”\\n“Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank.\\n“Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup.\\nThe firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into\\nhim, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him with some-\\nthing that was like courage.\\n“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained his own\\nglass in one.\\nThe atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching\\nLupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of\\nwhat they might hear.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n73\\n“I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill, “and I wondered that too, on\\nthe way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t they?\\nBut Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know there would be\\nseven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case\\nyou’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skull-\\nduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential point? I think Dung\\npanicked, it’s as simple as that. He didn’t want to come in the first place,\\nbut Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was\\nenough to make anyone panic.”\\n“You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,” sniffed\\nTonks. “Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest,\\nmost skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave\\nthem away he switched to Kingsley “\\n“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet does not\\nexplain ‘ow zey knew we were moving ‘Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody\\nmust ‘ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze\\nonly explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ‘ole plan.”\\nShe glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face,\\nsilently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound\\nto break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his hand-\\nkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own life to save\\nHarry’s – Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been\\ntricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a drag-\\non’s egg...\\n“No,” Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: The fire-\\nwhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “I mean... if somebody made a\\nmistake,” Harry went on, “and let something slip, I know they didn’t mean\\nto do it. It’s not their fault,” he repeated, again a little louder than he would\\nusually have spoken. “We’ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I\\ndon’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n74\\nMore silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry\\nfelt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do.\\nAs he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing\\nabout Dumbledore’s willingness to trust people.\\n“Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly.\\n“Yeah, ‘ear, ‘ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of\\nwhose mouth twitched.\\nLupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close\\nto pitying.\\n“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry.\\n“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have regarded\\nit as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.”\\nHarry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed\\nby his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue,\\nbut Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table,\\nand addressed Bill, “There’s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether –”\\n“No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.”\\n“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together. “Mad-Eye’s\\nbody,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.”\\n“Can’t it –?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. “Wait?”\\nsaid Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took it?” Nobody spoke.\\nLupin and Bill said good-bye and left.\\nThe rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who\\nremained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with\\nthem like a presence.\\n“I’ve got to go too,” said Harry.\\nTen pairs of startled eyes looked at him.\\n“Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What are you talking\\nabout?”\\n“I can’t stay here.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n75\\nHe rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had not hurt like this\\nfor more than a year.\\n“You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want –”\\n“But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole point of tonight\\nwas to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur’s\\nagreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything\\nso that we can all stay together and look after you –”\\nShe did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. “If\\nVoldemort finds out I’m here –”\\n“But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley.\\n“There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley.\\n“He’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re in.”\\n“It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry.\\n“We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “but it would make our efforts\\ntonight seem rather pointless if you left.”\\n“Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, Harry, after all we\\nwen’ through ter get you here?”\\n“Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting himself up\\non his cushions.\\n“I know that –”\\n“Mad-Eye wouldn’t want –”\\n“I KNOW!” Harry bellowed.\\nHe felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know\\nwhat they had done for him, didn’t they understand that it was for precisely\\nthat reason that he wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on\\nhis behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar conti-\\nnued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her up with\\nPigwidgeon and give her something to eat.”\\nHis insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank\\nthe last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n76\\n“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Escaped him,\\nfought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”\\n“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My wand acted of its\\nown accord.”\\nAfter a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impossible,\\nHarry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted inst-\\ninctively.”\\n“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where\\nVoldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a\\nspell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold\\nflames appear before.”\\n“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can\\nproduce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before\\nthey’re trained –”\\n“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burn-\\ning: He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagi-\\nning him to have power to match Voldemort’s.\\nNo one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that\\nhe came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on\\nits own before.\\nHis scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.\\nMuttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.\\nAs he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up, rustled\\nits enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the\\ngate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pound-\\ning forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.\\nDumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would\\nhave known how and why Harry’s wand had acted independently, because\\nDumbledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had\\nexplained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand\\nand Voldemort’s... But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n77\\nparents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to\\nthem again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with\\nfirewhisky...\\nAnd then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his\\nforehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.\\n“You told me the problem would be solved by using another’s wand!”\\nAnd into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags\\nupon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of\\nunendurable agony...\\n“No! No! I beg you, I beg you…”\\n“You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!”\\n“I did not... I swear I did not…”\\n“You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!”\\n“I swear I did not... I believed a different wand would work…”\\n“Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!”\\n“I cannot understand... The connection... exists only... between your two\\nwands…”\\n“Lies!”\\n“Please... I beg you…”\\nAnd Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort’s surge\\nof vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony –\\n“Harry?”\\nIt was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the\\ndarkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still\\ntingling. It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione\\nwere at his side.\\n“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione whispered. “You aren’t still\\nthinking of leaving?”\\n“Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on the back.\\n“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry’s\\nface. “You look awful!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n78\\n“Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better than Ollivander…”\\nWhen he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appa-\\nlled, but Hermione downright terrified.\\n“But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar – it wasn’t supposed to\\ndo this anymore! You mustn’t let that connection open up again – Dum-\\nbledore wanted you to close your mind!”\\nWhen he did not reply, she gripped his arm.\\n“Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the\\nWizarding world! Don’t let him inside your head too!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n79\\nCHAPTER SIX\\nTHE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS\\nT\\nhe shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that foll-\\nowed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door\\nlike the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry\\nfelt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and\\nthat he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon\\nas possible.\\n“Well, you can’t do anything about the” – Ron mouthed the word Hor-\\ncruxes – “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace on you. And we\\ncan plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,” he dropped his voice to a\\nwhisper, “d’you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats\\nare?”\\n“No,” Harry admitted.\\n“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron. “She said\\nshe was saving it for when you got here.”\\nThey were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just\\nleft for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny,\\nwhile Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n80\\n“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means I only\\nneed to stay here four days. Then I can –”\\n“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for the\\nwedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.”\\nHarry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. “It’s one extra\\nday,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. “Don’t they realize how im-\\nportant –?”\\n“‘Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now you\\nmention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.”\\nRon glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was\\nnot returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.\\n“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we’re off to\\ndo. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin’ve both asked as\\nwell, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us,\\nthey dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined.”\\nRon’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs.\\nWeasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a\\nlone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once\\nshe had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started.\\n“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out\\nof Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.\\n“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.”\\nThe mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what look-\\ned like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.\\n“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Well, Dumbledore left me... stuff to do,” mumbled Harry. “Ron and Her-\\nmione know about it, and they want to come too.”\\n“What sort of ‘stuff’?”\\n“I’m sorry, I can’t –”\\n“Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m sure\\nMr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n81\\nafraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced himself to look directly\\ninto her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade\\nof brown as Ginny’s. This did not help.\\n“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m sorry.\\nRon and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice –”\\n“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping all pre-\\ntense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense, if Dum-\\nbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! Harry,\\nyou must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something\\nhe wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you –”\\n“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to be me.”\\nHe handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying,\\nwhich was patterned with golden bulrushes.\\n“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.”\\n“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerv-\\ning return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well, Harry, while\\nwe’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the preparations for\\nBill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still so much to do.”\\n“No – I – of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change\\nof subject.\\n“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery.\\nFrom that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione so\\nbusy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to\\nthink. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs.\\nWeasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the\\nterrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning,\\nof color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden\\nand helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapés, however, Harry\\nstarted to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out\\nseemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n82\\nhad a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when\\nhe had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.\\n“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together\\nand planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” Ginny told Harry in an\\nundertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay.\\n“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry muttered.\\n“Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making\\nvol-au-vents?”\\nHe had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten. “So it’s\\ntrue?” she said. “That’s what you’re trying to do?”\\n“I – not – I was joking,” said Harry evasively.\\nThey stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in\\nGinny’s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first\\ntime that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded\\ncorners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them\\ntoo. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley,\\nand Bill walked in.\\nThey were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because\\nthe Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the head-\\nquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore,\\ntheir Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore had confided\\nGrimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn.\\n“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of\\nthe Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eat-\\ners to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold much\\nlonger.”\\n“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?”\\nasked Harry.\\n“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns\\nup there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and\\nto bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can’t be sure. It\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n83\\nwould have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its\\nprotection has become so shaky.”\\nThe kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver\\nknives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid\\nthings that had just passed between them made him wish they had been\\nseparated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing\\nher arm he could barely cut his chicken.\\n“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill. “Nothing,” replied Bill.\\nThey had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and\\nLupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he\\nmight have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.\\n“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about finding\\nthe body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean much. It’s keeping a lot\\nquiet these days.”\\n“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic I\\nused escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the table to Mr.\\nWeasley, who shook his head.\\n“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want me to\\ntell the world Voldemort attacked me?”\\n“The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-Know-\\nWho is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.”\\n“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his knife so\\ntightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white\\nagainst his skin: I must not tell lies.\\n“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked Ron\\nangrily.\\n“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied, “terrified\\nthat they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked!\\nThere are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t believe the Muggle\\nStudies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn’t been seen for weeks\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n84\\nnow. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I just\\nhope he’s working on a plan.”\\nThere was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates\\nonto the work surface and served apple tart.\\n“We must decide ‘ow you will be disguised, ‘Arry,” said Fleur, once\\neveryone had pudding. “For ze wedding,” she added, when he looked con-\\nfused. “Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot gua-\\nrantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ‘ave ‘ad champagne.”\\nFrom this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.\\n“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where\\nshe sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list\\nof jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. “Now,\\nRon, have you cleaned out your room yet?”\\n“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his\\nmother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine\\nwith it the way it is!”\\n“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time, young\\nman –”\\n“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furiously.\\n“No!\\nSo why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left –”\\n“Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “And do\\nas you’re told.”\\nRon scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked\\nthe last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.\\n“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut\\nacross him.\\n“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the\\nchickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets\\nfor Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at eleven\\ntomorrow morning.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n85\\nBut as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.\\n“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told Harry,\\nblocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what\\nwas left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding – that’s to say, keeping – it in\\nhere. Fantastic stuff: There’s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the\\nmost magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how\\nbrakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when\\nMolly’s not – I mean, when I’ve got time.”\\nWhen they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen,\\nso Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom.\\n“I’m doing it, I’m doing –! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry\\nentered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently\\njust vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only\\nchange was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy\\nginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry\\nrecognized as his own, into two enormous piles.\\n“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. “And how did you\\nmanage to get away?”\\n“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets\\nyesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto\\none pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other.\\n“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I reckon he\\nmight have survived.”\\n“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry.\\n“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be sure\\nwhat he saw?”\\n“Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand\\nfeet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland\\nin her hand.\\n“He could have used a Shield Charm –”\\n“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n86\\n“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily, punch-\\ning his pillow into a more comfortable shape.\\n“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking\\nshocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!”\\nFor the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye’s body, broken as Dum-\\nbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt\\na stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh.\\n“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no\\none’s found him,” said Ron wisely.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried\\nin Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed\\nhim –”\\n“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to\\nsee her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary.\\n“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. “Her-\\nmione, I wasn’t trying to upset –”\\nBut with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed\\nand got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket\\nand withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out\\nthe oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and\\nsaid, “Tergeo.”\\nThe wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with\\nhimself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.\\n“Oh... thanks, Ron... I’m sorry...” She blew her nose and hiccuped. “It’s\\njust so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore... I j-just n-never imagined\\nMad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!”\\n“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know what\\nhe’d say to us if he was here?”\\n“‘C-constant vigilance,’” said Hermione, mopping her eyes.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n87\\n“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from what happ-\\nened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit,\\nMundungus.”\\nHermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more\\nbooks. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her\\nshoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The\\nbook had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at\\nRon’s ankle.\\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from\\nRon’s leg and retied it shut.\\n“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked, limping\\nback to his bed.\\n“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When\\nwe’re looking for the Horcruxes.”\\n“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot we’ll\\nbe hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”\\n“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I\\nwonder... will we need to translate runes? It’s possible... I think we’d better\\ntake it, to be safe.”\\nShe dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up\\nHogwarts: A History.\\n“Listen,” said Harry.\\nHe had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar\\nmixtures of resignation and defiance.\\n“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come\\nwith me,” Harry began.\\n“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.\\n“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You\\nknow, I think I will take Hogwarts: A History. Even if we’re not going back\\nthere, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with –”\\n“Listen!” said Harry again.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n88\\n“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you. That\\nwas decided months ago – years, really.”\\n“But –”\\n“Shut up,” Ron advised him.\\n“– are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted.\\n“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the\\ndiscarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for days, so\\nwe’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your information has\\nincluded doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-\\nEye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s nose.\\n“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced\\nthey’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s\\nambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to make\\nit more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them\\nabout me – or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about\\nyou.\\n“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad\\nand lift the enchantment. If I don’t – well, I think I’ve cast a good enough\\ncharm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don’t\\nknow that they’ve got a daughter, you see.”\\nHermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the\\nbed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though\\nreproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say,\\nnot least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else\\ntact.\\n“I – Hermione, I’m sorry – I didn’t –”\\n“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if\\nwe come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.”\\n“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron. “Go on, he needs to know!”\\n“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n89\\nFor the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and\\nstumped over to the door.\\n“C’mon.”\\n“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny land-\\ning. “Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A\\nhatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A\\nhorrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole,\\nalong with an unpleasant smell like open drains.\\n“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met\\nthe creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.\\n“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look at\\nhim.”\\nHarry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His\\nhead and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature\\ncurled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth\\nwide open.\\n“But it... it looks... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?”\\n“No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of\\npustules.”\\nHarry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape\\nand size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became used to the\\ndarkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. He was also sure that\\nghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and\\ncovered in angry purple blisters.\\n“He’s me, see?” said Ron. “No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”\\n“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said Ron.\\nThey climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and\\nrejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.\\n“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my\\nroom,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it – well, it’s hard\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n90\\nto tell, because all he can do is moan and drool – but he nods a lot when you\\nmention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?”\\nHarry merely looked his confusion.\\n“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilli-\\nance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts again,\\neveryone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which\\nmeans the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got\\ninformation on where you are.”\\n“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of\\nMuggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said\\nHermione.\\n“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t all\\nleave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story that I’m\\nseriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If\\nanyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul\\nin my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit’s really contagious, so they’re\\nnot going to want to go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t say anything,\\neither, because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your\\nuvula.”\\n“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.\\n“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum... well,\\nyou’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.”\\nThere was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione\\ncontinued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her,\\nand Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The mea-\\nsures they had taken to protect their families made him realize, more than\\nanything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him\\nand that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell\\nthem what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important\\nenough.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n91\\nThrough the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting\\nfrom four floors below.\\n“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said Ron.\\n“I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the\\nwedding.”\\n“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and\\nshe’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as she pored indeci-\\nsively over Break with a Banshee.\\n“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said Ron.\\n“What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive\\nMagical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An\\nAppraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re going after we\\nleave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow first,\\nHarry, and I understand why, but... well... shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes\\nour priority?”\\n“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,” said\\nHarry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to\\nreturn to Godric’s Hollow. His parents’ graves were only part of the\\nattraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held\\nanswers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had\\nsurvived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge\\nof repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened,\\nwanting to understand.\\n“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch\\non Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect you to go back\\nand visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like?”\\nThis had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counter-\\nargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought.\\n“This R.A.B. person,” he said. “You know, the one who stole the real\\nlocket?”\\nHermione nodded.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n92\\n“He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?”\\nHarry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux\\nin which R.A.B.’s note was still folded.\\n“‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can,’”\\nHarry read out.\\n“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron. “Or she,” interposed Her-\\nmione.\\n“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!”\\n“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t\\nwe?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.”\\n“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked Ron.\\n“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.”\\n“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes\\nin the library?”\\n“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumbledore\\nremoved them all, but he – he didn’t destroy them.”\\nRon sat up straight, wide-eyed.\\n“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands\\non those Horcrux books?”\\n“It – it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with\\na kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even if Dumbledore\\nhad taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to\\nget at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to –”\\n“Get to the point!” said Ron.\\n“Well... it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a Summ-\\noning Charm. You know – Accio. And – they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s\\nstudy window right into the girls’ dormitory.”\\n“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a\\nmixture of admiration and incredulity.\\n“Just after his – Dumbledore’s – funeral,” said Hermione in an even sma-\\nller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n93\\nHorcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it – it just occurred\\nto me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be... and I was\\nalone in there... so I tried... and it worked. They flew straight in through the\\nopen window and I – I packed them.”\\nShe swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dumbledore\\nwould have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the inform-\\nation to make a Horcrux, is it?”\\n“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these books any-\\nway?”\\nHermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a\\nlarge volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated\\nand held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead.\\n“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux.\\nSecrets of the Darkest Art – it’s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil\\nmagic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library... If he\\ndidn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction\\nhe needed from here.”\\n“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d\\nalready read that?” asked Ron.\\n“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split\\nyour soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure Riddle already\\nknew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I\\nthink you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the\\ninformation.”\\n“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more horrible\\nthey seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in\\nthis book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and\\nthat’s just by making one Horcrux!”\\nHarry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving\\nbeyond “usual evil.”\\n“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron asked.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n94\\n“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be excruci-\\natingly painful.”\\n“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.\\n“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done.\\nThere’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see\\nVoldemort attempting it somehow, can you?”\\n“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to\\ndestroy Horcruxes in that book?”\\n“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining\\nrotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to\\nmake the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to\\nRiddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a\\nHorcrux.”\\n“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.\\n“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,”\\nsaid Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”\\n“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to\\nbe something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk\\nvenom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare –”\\n“– phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.\\n“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few sub-\\nstances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous to carry\\naround with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve, though,\\nbecause ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick.\\nYou’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.”\\n“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t the bit\\nof soul in it just go and live in something else?”\\n“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”\\nSeeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurr-\\nied on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through\\nwith it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n95\\n“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron. Harry\\nlaughed.\\n“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your\\nbody, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s the other\\nway round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its\\ncontainer, its enchanted body, for survival. It can’t exist without it.”\\n“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remembering ink\\npouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece\\nof Voldemort’s soul as it vanished.\\n“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it\\ncould no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did,\\nflushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.”\\n“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was\\npossessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”\\n“While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit\\nin and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean hold-\\ning it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before Ron\\ncould speak. “I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into\\nthat diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you\\nget too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.”\\n“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry. “Why didn’t\\nI ask him? I never really...”\\nHis voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have\\nasked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to\\nHarry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been\\nalive, to find out more... to find out everything...\\nThe silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-\\nshaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art;\\nCrookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off\\nthe bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his\\nhead on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n96\\nrealizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was dish-\\neveled and whose face was contorted with rage.\\n“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her voice\\ntrembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents\\nstacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression\\nthat you had agreed to help.”\\n“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet,\\nsending books flying in every direction, “we will... we’re sorry…”\\nWith an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the\\nroom after Mrs. Weasley.\\n“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone, still\\nmassaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without the job\\nsatisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes\\nIt’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?”\\nRon started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding\\npresents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite abruptly.\\nThe Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. Harry,\\nRon, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s\\nfamily by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs\\nto put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once they\\nhad all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard\\nto await the visitors.\\nHarry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and\\nold Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were\\ngone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door\\nin large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving\\nan attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had\\nbeen swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally\\nspruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that\\nit looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n97\\nHe had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed\\nupon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that\\nit was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the\\nplace. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a\\nnearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their\\napproach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be\\ncoming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden\\nwith luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green\\nrobes, who could only be Fleur’s mother.\\n“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!”\\nMonsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a\\nhead shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. How-\\never, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on high-\\nheeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered.\\n“You ‘ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur tells us\\nyou ‘ave been working very ‘ard.”\\n“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trouble at\\nall!”\\nRon relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering\\nout from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.\\n“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s hand\\nbetween his own two plump ones and beaming. “We are most honored at\\nthe approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife, Apo-\\nlline.”\\nMadame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too.\\n“Enchantée,” she said. “Your ‘usband ‘as been telling us such amusing\\nstories!”\\nMr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look,\\nupon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression\\nappropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n98\\n“And, of course, you ‘ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said\\nMonsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with\\nwaist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling\\nsmile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eye-\\nlashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.\\n“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the\\nDelacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and\\n“Not at all!”s.\\nThe Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They\\nwere pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for\\nthe wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating\\nplan to the bridesmaids’ shoes “Charmant!” Madame Delacour was most\\naccomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a\\ntrice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way\\nshe could and jabbering away in rapid French.\\nOn the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many\\npeople. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having\\nshouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and insisted they\\ntake their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s old room,\\nand Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived\\nfrom Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually\\nnonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took\\nto volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.\\n“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt\\nat a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley\\ncarrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.\\n“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them.\\n“We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow... to put\\nup the tent for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean against the hen-\\nhouse. She looked exhausted. “Millamant’s Magic Marquees... they’re very\\ngood, Bill’s escorting them... You’d better stay inside while they’re here,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n99\\nHarry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these\\nsecurity spells around the place.”\\n“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly.\\n“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t mean –\\nwell, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve been wanting to\\nask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after\\nall, it’s an important day…”\\n“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain\\nthis would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner\\nwould be fine... It’s the day before the wedding…”\\n“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And\\nhow about Hagrid?”\\n“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of trouble.”\\n“Not at all, not at all... It’s no trouble…”\\nShe looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly,\\nstraightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand\\nnear the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang them-\\nselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the incon-\\nvenience and the pain he was giving her.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n100\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\nTHE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nH\\ne was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn.\\nFar below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man\\nhe sought down there, the man he needed so badly he could think of little\\nelse, the man who held the answer, the answer to his problem...? “Oi, wake\\nup.”\\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron’s\\ndingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy.\\nPigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on\\nHarry’s forehead was prickling.\\n“You were muttering in your sleep.”\\n“Was I?”\\n“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’”\\nHarry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly blurred.\\n“Who’s Gregorovitch?”\\n“I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.”\\nHarry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard\\nthe name before, but he could not think where.\\n“I think Voldemort’s looking for him.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n101\\n“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently.\\nHarry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remem-\\nber exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a\\nmountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep\\nvalley.\\n“I think he’s abroad.”\\n“Who, Gregorovitch?”\\n“Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It\\ndidn’t look like anywhere in Britain.”\\n“You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?” Ron sounded\\nworried.\\n“Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. “Although how she\\nexpects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep...”\\nHe gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking... Why was the name\\n“Gregorovitch” familiar?\\n“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quidditch.\\nThere’s some connection, but I can’t – I can’t think what it is.”\\n“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgovitch?”\\n“Who?”\\n“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a\\nrecord fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.”\\n“No,” said Harry. “I’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.”\\n“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.”\\n“Wow – that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen!”\\nHarry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the\\ncluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said, “Accio Glasses!”\\nAlthough they were only around a foot away, there was something imm-\\nensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they\\npoked him in the eye.\\n“Slick,” snorted Ron.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n102\\nReveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s possessions flying\\naround the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly\\naround his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the\\nresultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the\\npleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters\\nbright blue.\\n“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering when\\nHarry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s\\nnot for my mother’s eyes.”\\n“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit of a depar-\\nture from tradition, isn’t it?”\\n“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold: Twelve Fail-\\nSafe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about\\ngirls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of\\nLavender and I would’ve known how to get going with... Well, Fred and\\nGeorge gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not\\nall about wandwork, either.”\\nWhen they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on\\nthe table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while\\nMrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan.\\n“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs.\\nWeasley, beaming at him. “He had to leave early for work, but he’ll be back\\nfor dinner. That’s our present on top.”\\nHarry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped\\nit. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given\\nRon for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face\\ninstead of hands.\\n“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,” said\\nMrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. “I’m afraid\\nthat one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n103\\nwasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back,\\nbut –”\\nThe rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He\\ntried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood\\nthem, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then\\nwaved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to\\nflop out of the frying pan onto the floor.\\n“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and\\nadding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s not much, but I hope you\\nlike it. What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear\\nher.\\n“Come on, then, open Hermione’s!” said Ron.\\nShe had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained\\nan enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze\\nsmoothest shave you will ever ‘ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, “but\\nyou must tell it clearly what you want... ozzerwise you might find you ‘ave\\na leetle less hair zan you would like...”), chocolates from the Delacours, and\\nan enormous box of the latest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes merchandise\\nfrom Fred and George.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of\\nMadame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably\\ncrowded.\\n“I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s presents\\nout of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. “I’m nearly done,\\nI’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash,\\nRon –”\\nRon’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor\\nlanding.\\n“Harry, will you come in here a moment?”\\nIt was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the\\nelbow and tugged him on up the stairs.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n104\\nFeeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room.\\nHe had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a\\nlarge poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a\\npicture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the\\nHolyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window,\\nwhich looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played\\ntwo-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a\\nlarge, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s\\nwindow.\\nGinny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy\\nseventeenth.”\\n“Yeah... thanks.”\\nShe was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to look\\nback at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.\\n“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window. She ignored\\nthis. He could not blame her.\\n“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said. “You didn’t have to get me\\nanything.”\\nShe disregarded this too.\\n“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you\\nwouldn’t be able to take it with you.”\\nHe chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many\\nwonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes\\nthought that having six brothers must have toughened her up.\\nShe took a step closer to him.\\n“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by,\\nyou know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re\\ndoing.”\\n“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to\\nbe honest.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n105\\n“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered, and then\\nshe was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was\\nkissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; she\\nwas the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her\\nback and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair –\\nThe door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. “Oh,” said\\nRon pointedly. “Sorry.”\\n“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was\\na strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice, “Well, happy birth-\\nday anyway, Harry.”\\nRon’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam\\nthe door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room\\nwhen the door opened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap\\nbubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying\\nwell away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and\\nall happy forgetfulness was gone.\\nHe looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew\\nwhat, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have\\nsuccumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in\\nfront of Ron.\\n“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bed-\\nroom. Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into\\nthe yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along\\nbehind them looking scared.\\nOnce he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded\\non Harry.\\n“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?”\\n“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught up with\\nthem.\\n“Ron –”\\nBut Ron held up a hand to silence her.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n106\\n“She was really cut up when you ended it –”\\n“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted\\nto.”\\n“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes\\nup again –”\\n“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to\\n– to end up married, or –”\\nAs he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white\\ndress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling\\nmoment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered,\\nwhereas his... he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.\\n“If you keep groping her every chance you get –”\\n“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but\\nhe felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?”\\nRon looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and for-\\nward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s... yeah.”\\nGinny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of\\nthe day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more\\nthan polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came\\nas a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force\\nCharlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was\\nabout to get a proper haircut.\\nAs Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to\\nbreaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid,\\nseveral tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George\\nbewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number\\n17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s ministrati-\\nons, George’s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the\\ndark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it.\\nHermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand\\nand drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n107\\n“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned\\nthe leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve really got an eye for that\\nsort of thing.”\\n“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little con-\\nfused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he\\nwould find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy\\nof Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and\\ngrinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking\\nup a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.\\n“Out of the way, out of the way!” sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through\\nthe gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating\\nin front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake,\\nwhich Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk\\ncarrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the\\nmiddle of the table, Harry said,\\n“That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.”\\n“Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave\\nHarry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.\\nBy seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred\\nand George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had\\nhonored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit.\\nAlthough Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand, Harry thought he looked\\nrather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply\\nradiant.\\n“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly.\\n“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine\\nfrom Fred. “Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?”\\n“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you smash down the\\nfront door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?”\\n“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid chortled. “All righ’, Ron, Hermione?”\\n“We’re fine,” said Hermione. “How are you?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n108\\n“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns, I’ll show yeh\\nwhen yeh get back –” Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes as Hagrid\\nrummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry – couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but\\nthen I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring\\npouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck.\\n“Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can get it out.\\nThey’re rare, them.”\\n“Hagrid, thanks!”\\n“‘S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. “An’\\nthere’s Charlie! Always liked him – hey! Charlie!”\\nCharlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new,\\nbrutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of\\nburns and scratches up his muscley arms.\\n“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?”\\n“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin’?”\\n“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her\\nNorberta now.”\\n“Wha – Norbert’s a girl?”\\n“Oh yeah,” said Charlie.\\n“How can you tell?” asked Hermione.\\n“They’re a lot more vicious,” said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder\\nand dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum’s\\ngetting edgy.”\\nThey all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame\\nDelacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.\\n“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the garden at large\\nafter a moment or two. “He must have been held up at – oh!”\\nThey all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across\\nthe yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver\\nweasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley’s voice.\\n“Minister of Magic coming with me.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n109\\nThe Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family peering in\\nastonishment at the place where it had vanished.\\n“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry – I’m sorry – I’ll\\nexplain another time –”\\nHe seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence,\\nclimbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered.\\n“The Minister – but why –? I don’t understand –”\\nBut there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley\\nhad appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour,\\ninstantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.\\nThe two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the\\nlantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer.\\nAs Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he\\nlooked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.\\n“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the\\ntable. “Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.”\\nHis eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. “Many happy\\nreturns.”\\n“Thanks,” said Harry.\\n“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also with Mr.\\nRonald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.”\\n“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised. “Why us?”\\n“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said Scrim-\\ngeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.\\n“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting\\nroom, why don’t you use that?”\\n“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need\\nfor you to accompany us, Arthur.”\\nHarry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as\\nhe, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in\\nsilence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was:\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n110\\nScrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were\\nplanning to drop out of Hogwarts.\\nScrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen\\nand into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of\\nsoft golden evening light, it was already dark in here: Harry flicked his wand\\nat the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy\\nroom. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley\\nnormally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by\\nside onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.\\n“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if\\nwe do it individually. If you two” – he pointed at Harry and Hermione –\\n“can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”\\n“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigo-\\nrously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”\\nScrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression\\nthat the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening\\nhostilities this early.\\n“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. “I\\nam here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.\\n“A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had\\nleft you anything?”\\n“A-all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?”\\n“Yes, all of –”\\nBut Harry interrupted.\\n“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give\\nus what he left us?”\\n“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer.\\n“They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do\\nthat!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n111\\n“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for Justi-\\nfiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents\\nof a will –”\\n“That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,” said\\nHermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the\\ndeceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me\\nthat you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?”\\n“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?”\\nasked Scrimgeour.\\n“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some good in the\\nworld!”\\nRon laughed. Scrimgeour’s eyes flickered toward him and away again as\\nHarry spoke.\\n“So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t think of\\na pretext to keep them?”\\n“No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said Hermione at once.\\n“They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re\\ndangerous. Right?”\\n“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked Scrim-\\ngeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.\\n“Me? Not – not really... It was always Harry who...”\\nRon looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him\\na stop-talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour\\nlooked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted,\\nto hear.\\nHe swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron’s answer.\\n“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the\\nfact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few\\npersonal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions – his private library,\\nhis magical instruments, and other personal effects – were left to Hogwarts.\\nWhy do you think you were singled out?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n112\\n“I... dunno,” said Ron. “I... when I say we weren’t close... I mean, I think\\nhe liked me…”\\n“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was very\\nfond of you.”\\nThis was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron\\nand Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between\\nthem had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be\\nlistening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch\\nmuch larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a\\nscroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud.\\n“‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dum-\\nbledore’... Yes, here we are... ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Delu-\\nminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.’”\\nScrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It\\nlooked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the\\npower to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click.\\nScrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took\\nit and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned.\\n“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even\\nbe unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have\\nleft you an item so rare?”\\nRon shook his head, looking bewildered.\\n“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrimgeour\\npersevered. “Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three.\\nWhy is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr.\\nWeasley?”\\n“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do with it?”\\nEvidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a\\nmoment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will.\\n“‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n113\\nBeedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and inst-\\nructive.’”\\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient\\nas the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained\\nand peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word.\\nShe held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in\\nrunes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto\\nthe embossed symbols.\\n“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?” asked\\nScrimgeour.\\n“He... he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping\\nher eyes with her sleeve.\\n“But why that particular book?”\\n“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”\\n“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages,\\nwith Dumbledore?”\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “And\\nif the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days,\\nI doubt that I will.”\\nShe suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had\\ndifficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s shoulders. Scrim-\\ngeour turned back to the will.\\n“‘To Harry James Potter,’” he read, and Harry’s insides contracted with\\na sudden excitement, “‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch\\nmatch at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.’”\\nAs Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver\\nwings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite\\nsense of anticlimax.\\n“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.\\n“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to\\nremind me what you can get if you... persevere and whatever it was.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n114\\n“You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?”\\n“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?”\\n“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little\\ncloser to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond\\nthe windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.\\n“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,” Scrimgeour\\nsaid to Harry. “Why is that?”\\nHermione laughed derisively.\\n“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way\\ntoo obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from Dumbledore\\nhidden in the icing!”\\n“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but\\na Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know\\nwhy, I’m sure?”\\nHarry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that\\nanswering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could\\nnot suppress the urge.\\n“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said.\\n“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione’s\\nQuidditch knowledge negligible.\\n“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before\\nit is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an\\nenchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it,\\nin case of a disputed capture. This Snitch” – he held up the tiny golden ball\\n– “will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who\\nhad prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have ench-\\nanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.”\\nHarry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was\\nright. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of\\nthe Minister?\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n115\\n“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already know\\nwhat the Snitch contains?”\\n“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch\\nwithout really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and\\ncould read Hermione’s mind; he could practically hear her brain whirring\\nbeside him.\\n“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly.\\nHarry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to\\nobey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and\\nplaced the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s palm.\\nNothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired\\nwings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued\\nto gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might\\ntransform in some way.\\n“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laugh-\\ned. “That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the\\nsofa.\\n“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad-tempered now. “Dumble-\\ndore left you a second bequest, Potter.”\\n“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling. Scrimgeour did not\\nbother to read from the will this time. “The sword of Godric Gryffindor,”\\nhe said.\\nHermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the\\nruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather\\npouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it.\\n“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously.\\n“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumbledore’s to\\ngive away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical arti-\\nfact, and as such, belongs –”\\n“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was the one\\nwho found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n116\\n“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to\\nany worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not make it the\\nexclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.”\\nScrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do\\nyou think –?”\\n“– Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry, struggling to\\nkeep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.”\\n“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because Dum-\\nbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the\\nHeir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he\\nbelieved, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-\\nMustNot-Be-Named?”\\n“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword\\nin Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that,\\ninstead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up\\nbreakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut\\nup in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying – I was\\nnearly one of them – Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed\\nMad-Eye Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the\\nMinistry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!”\\n“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his\\nfeet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest\\nwith the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry’s T-shirt like a lit\\ncigarette.\\n“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said,\\n“No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?”\\n“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour, breath-\\ning hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who\\nforgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a\\ncrown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to\\ndo my job! It’s time you learned some respect!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n117\\n“It’s time you earned it,” said Harry.\\nThe floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door\\nto the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in.\\n“We – we thought we heard –” began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly\\nalarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose.\\n“– raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley.\\nScrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole\\nhe had made in Harry’s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper.\\n“It – it was nothing,” he growled. “I... regret your attitude,” he said, look-\\ning Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to think that the Ministry\\ndoes not desire what you – what Dumbledore – desired. We ought to be\\nworking together.”\\n“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?”\\nFor the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour\\nthe scars that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell\\nlies. Scrimgeour’s expression hardened. He turned away without another\\nword and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry\\nheard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!”\\n“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them.\\n“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve only just\\nreleased the contents of his will.”\\nOutside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour\\nhad given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over\\nthe Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact\\nthat Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could\\noffer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old\\nSnitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth\\ntime, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully hung-\\nry, we didn’t like to start without you Shall I serve dinner now?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n118\\nThey all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of “Happy\\nBirthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was\\ninvited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in\\nthe overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring\\nfield.\\n“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped\\nMrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After everyone’s gone\\nto bed.”\\nUp in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled\\nHagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most priz-\\ned, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map,\\nthe shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the\\nstrings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old\\nSnitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on\\nthe door and tiptoed inside.\\n“Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the\\nstairs. “Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.\\n“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”\\nRon obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The\\nsolitary lamp they had lit went out at once.\\n“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have\\nachieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”\\nThere was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to\\nthe ceiling and illuminated them all once more.\\n“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,\\nDumbledore invented it himself!”\\n“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to\\nhelp us turn out the lights!”\\n“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and\\nexamine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n119\\n“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was\\nleaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain...”\\n“... why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked Ron.\\n“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle\\nthe Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on right under the\\nnose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why... unless he\\nthought it was obvious?”\\n“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he was\\nmental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch\\n– what the hell was that about?”\\n“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take it,\\nHarry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!”\\n“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in\\nhis fingers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?”\\n“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.\\n“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?” said Harry.\\n“Don’t you remember?”\\nHermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing\\nfrantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice.\\n“That was the one you nearly swallowed!”\\n“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his\\nmouth to the Snitch.\\nIt did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside\\nhim: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.\\n“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!”\\nHe nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was\\nquite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds\\nbefore there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting\\nhandwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore’s:\\nI open at the close.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n120\\nHe had barely read them when the words vanished again. “‘I open at the\\nclose...’ What’s that supposed to mean?”\\nHermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.\\n“I open at the close... at the close... I open at the close...”\\nBut no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different\\ninflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.\\n“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their\\nattempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription. “Why did he want\\nHarry to have the sword?”\\n“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “It was\\nthere, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year!\\nIf he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then?”\\nHe felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he\\nought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unres-\\nponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dum-\\nbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore\\nexpected him to understand?\\n“And as for this book,” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard...\\nI’ve never even heard of them!”\\n“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said Ron incre-\\ndulously. “You’re kidding, right?”\\n“No, I’m not!” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them, then?”\\n“Well, of course I do!”\\nHarry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book\\nthat Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused\\nby their surprise.\\n“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t\\nthey? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’... ‘The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’...\\n‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’...”\\n“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that last one?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n121\\n“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione.\\n“You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty –”\\n“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said\\nHermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard\\n‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ –”\\n“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron.\\n“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending again over\\nthe runes.\\n“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you hear, you\\nknow, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like\\nin the original versions.”\\n“But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?” Something\\ncreaked downstairs.\\n“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his\\nhair,” said Ron nervously.\\n“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione. “It wouldn’t\\ndo to oversleep tomorrow.”\\n“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother\\nmight put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I’ll get the lights.”\\nAnd he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n122\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\nTHE WEDDING\\nT\\nhree o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and\\nGeorge standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting\\nthe arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice\\nPotion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local\\nvillage, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a\\nSummoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as “Cousin Barny”\\nand trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. All\\nfour of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show\\npeople to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour\\nearlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and all of these wizards were\\ncurrently sitting a short distance away under a tree; Harry could see a blue\\nhaze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot.\\nBehind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of\\nfragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supp-\\norting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George\\nhad fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point\\nwhere Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside,\\nbutterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n123\\nHarry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was\\naffecting was slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight\\nin the full glare of a summer’s day.\\n“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes,\\n“I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you\\nlike, and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.”\\n“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George. “Cried a\\nbit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace\\nyourselves – here they come, look.”\\nBrightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at\\nthe distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed,\\nwhich began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee.\\nExotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches’ hats, while\\nprecious gems glittered from many of the wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited\\nchatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd\\napproached the tent.\\n“Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said George, craning his\\nneck for a better look. “They’ll need help understanding our English cus-\\ntoms, I’ll look after them…”\\n“Not so fast, Your Holeyness,” said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of\\nmiddle-aged witches heading the procession, he said, “Here – permettez-\\nmoi to assister vous,” to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allow-\\ned him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged\\nwitches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague Perk-\\nins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry’s lot.\\n“Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and\\nfound Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for\\nthe occasion. “Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry\\nabout last night,” she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle.\\n“The Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought\\nour presence might not do you any favors.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n124\\n“It’s fine, I understand,” said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks.\\nLupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin’s\\nface fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was\\nno time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of\\ndisruption. Having misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not\\nupon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back\\nrow, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.\\nWhile Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies\\nto anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron\\nface-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with\\nshoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose\\ntassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of\\neggyolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from\\na golden chain around his neck.\\n“Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to Harry, “my dau-\\nghter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us.\\nBut I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron.\\n“Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?”\\n“She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes,\\nsuch a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can\\nlearn from the wise little gnomes – or, to give them their correct name, the\\nGernumbli gardensi.”\\n“Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said Ron, “but I think\\nFred and George taught them those.”\\nHe led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. “Hello,\\nHarry!” she said.\\n“Er – my name’s Barny,” said Harry, flummoxed. “Oh, have you changed\\nthat too?” she asked brightly. “How did you know –?”\\n“Oh, just your expression,” she said.\\nLike her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had\\naccessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got over the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n125\\nbrightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were\\nno radishes dangling from her ears.\\nXenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had\\nmissed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizard farewell,\\nhe turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, “Daddy, look –\\none of the gnomes actually bit me!”\\n“How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!” said Mr.\\nLovegood, seizing Luna’s outstretched finger and examining the bleeding\\npuncture marks. “Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent\\ntoday – perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish\\n– do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!” Ron,\\npassing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort.\\n“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius\\ntoward their seats, “but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli\\nmagic.”\\n“Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna\\nor her father’s peculiar views. “Are you sure you don’t want to put anything\\non that bite, though?”\\n“Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and\\nlooking Harry up and down. “You look smart. I told Daddy most people\\nwould probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun\\ncolors to a wedding, for luck, you know.”\\nAs she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch\\nclutching his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and feathery pink hat\\ngave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo.\\n“... and your hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you\\nwere Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He\\nlooks like an omelet. And who are you?” she barked at Harry.\\n“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.”\\n“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter here? I\\nwas hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n126\\nyou merely been boasting?”\\n“No – he couldn’t come –”\\n“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press\\nphotographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear\\nmy tiara,” she shouted at Harry. “Goblin-made, you know, and been in my\\nfamily for centuries. She’s a good-looking girl, but still – French. Well,\\nwell, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not\\nto be on my feet too long.”\\nRon gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for\\nsome time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen\\nmore people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the\\nfirst time there was no queue outside.\\n“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve.\\n“She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took\\noffense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at\\ndinner. Dad always says she’ll have written them out of her will – like they\\ncare, they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re\\ngoing... Wow,” he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurry-\\ning toward them. “You look great!”\\n“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she smiled. She\\nwas wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair\\nwas sleek and shiny. “Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her\\nupstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the\\nMuggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.’”\\n“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron.\\n“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the marquee\\nwith Fred. “Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish\\nold Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at wedd-\\nings.”\\n“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?”\\nasked Hermione.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n127\\n“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded George.\\n“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,” said\\nFred. “He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the\\ndance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of\\nhis –”\\n“Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry roared with\\nlaughter.\\n“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron. “You amaze me,” said Her-\\nmione.\\nThey were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer,\\na dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eye-\\nbrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on\\nHermione, “You look vunderful.”\\n“Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made\\na loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing,\\nto pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you were – goodness – it’s lovely to\\nsee – how are you?”\\nRon’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s invi-\\ntation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, “How\\ncome you’re here?”\\n“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised.\\nHarry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that\\nit would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicinity, offered to show\\nhim his seat.\\n“Your friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as they entered the now\\npacked marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s\\nred curly hair.\\n“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His\\nappearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He\\nwas, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n128\\ntheir necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George\\ncame hurrying down the aisle.\\n“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run over by\\nthe bride.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred\\nand George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet.\\nAfter a few moments he muttered to Harry, “Did you see he’s grown a\\nstupid little beard?”\\nHarry gave a noncommittal grunt.\\nA sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general mur-\\nmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley\\nwas wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-colored robes with a matching\\nhat.\\nA moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee,\\nboth wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their buttonholes; Fred\\nwolfwhistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins.\\nThen the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the\\ngolden balloons.\\n“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the ent-\\nrance.\\nA great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as\\nMonsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding,\\nMonsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very\\nsimple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While\\nher radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it\\nbeautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden\\ndresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him,\\nBill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.\\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight\\nshock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n129\\nDumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur. “We are\\ngathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls...”\\n“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said Auntie Muriel in a\\nrather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.”\\nGinny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the\\nfront again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to\\nafternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds.\\nThey seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as\\nthough he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person’s life, a\\nperson without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead...\\n“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle?”\\nIn the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing\\nquietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the\\nmarquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-\\nsized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes too\\nwere full of tears.\\n“– then I declare you bonded for life.”\\nThe tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and\\nFleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now\\nentwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden\\nballoons overhead burst: Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and\\nfloated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.\\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tufty-haired wizard. “If you would\\nplease stand up!”\\nThey all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand\\nagain. The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air\\nas the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a\\ncanopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard\\nand surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the\\ncenter of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs group-\\ned themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated grace-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n130\\nfully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed band trooped toward\\na podium.\\n“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides,\\nsome bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky,\\nothers tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.\\n“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing on\\ntiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of\\nwellwishers.\\n“We’ll have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from\\na passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione, cop hold, let’s grab a\\ntable Not there! Nowhere near Muriel –”\\nRon led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as\\nhe went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the\\ntime they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were\\noccupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.\\n“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.\\n“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our\\npresent.”\\n“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron.\\nHermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead.\\nEyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few mom-\\nents.\\nThe band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first,\\nto great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto\\nthe floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father.\\n“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a\\nfew seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she\\nrevolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.\\n“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always good value.”\\nBut the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped\\ninto Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered, but this\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n131\\ntime Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he\\nsaid, “Who is that man in the yellow?”\\n“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,” said\\nRon. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at\\nXenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and dance,” he added\\nabruptly to Hermione.\\nShe looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished\\ntogether into the growing throng on the dance floor.\\n“Ah, they are together now?” asked Krum, momentarily distracted. “Er –\\nsort of,” said Harry.\\n“Who are you?” Krum asked.\\n“Barny Weasley.” They shook hands.\\n“You, Barny – you know this man Lovegood vell?”\\n“No, I only met him today. Why?”\\nKrum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was\\nchatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor.\\n“Because,” said Krum, “if he vos not a guest of Fleur’s, I vould duel him,\\nhere and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.”\\n“Sign?” said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange\\ntriangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “Why? What’s wrong with it?”\\n“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.”\\n“Grindelwald... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?”\\n“Exactly.”\\nKrum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, “Grin-\\ndelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos\\nnever poverful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore – and\\nrightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this” – he pointed a finger at\\nXenophilius – “this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald\\ncarved it into a vall at Durmstrang ven he vos a pupil there. Some idiots\\ncopied it onto their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n132\\nimpressive – until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald\\ntaught them better.”\\nKrum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius.\\nHarry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a\\nsupporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have\\nrecognized the triangular, runelike shape.\\n“Are you – er – quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s –?”\\n“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign for several\\nyears, I know it vell.”\\n“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius doesn’t actually\\nknow what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite... unusual. He could\\neasily have picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section of the head\\nof a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.”\\n“The cross section of a vot?”\\n“Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go\\non holiday looking for them…”\\nHarry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father.\\n“That’s her,” he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, wav-\\ning her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges.\\n“Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum.\\n“Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,” said Harry, who recognized\\nthe symptoms.\\nKrum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him.\\nHe drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his\\nthigh; sparks flew out of the end.\\n“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too\\nexcited to care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum’s\\nwand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard\\nTournament.\\n“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously. “He’s a wandmaker!”\\n“I know that,” said Krum.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n133\\n“He made your wand! That’s why I thought – Quidditch –” Krum was\\nlooking more and more suspicious.\\n“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?”\\n“I... I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a – a fan magazine,” he\\nimprovised wildly and Krum looked mollified.\\n“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he said. “So...\\ner... where is Gregorovitch these days?”\\nKrum looked puzzled.\\n“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregor-\\novitch vand. They are the best – although I know, of course, that you Britons\\nset much store by Ollivander.”\\nHarry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but\\nhe was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wand-\\nmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely\\nbecause of what Harry’s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had\\npursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had con-\\nquered the borrowed wand, something that Ollivander had not anticipated\\nor understood. Would Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled\\nthan Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?\\n“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to his surr-\\noundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. “She is\\nalso a relative of yours?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone. Jeal-\\nous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.”\\nKrum grunted.\\n“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the\\npoint of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls\\nare taken?”\\nAnd he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter\\nand make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted\\nto find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but Ron was dancing with\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n134\\nHermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the\\ngolden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and\\nGeorge’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise\\nhe had given Ron.\\nHe had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wiz-\\narding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure\\nthat the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model\\nphoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne\\nthat floated unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in, and moths\\nbegan to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the\\nrevelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long\\nsince disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie,\\nHagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing “Odo the\\nHero” in a corner.\\nWandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s\\nwho seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old\\nwizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather\\nlike an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was\\nvaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was\\nElphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dum-\\nbledore’s obituary.\\nHarry approached him. “May I sit down?”\\n“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy\\nvoice.\\nHarry leaned in.\\n“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.” Doge gasped.\\n“My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised... I am so glad,\\nso honored!”\\nIn a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of cham-\\npagne. “I thought of writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore... the\\nshock... and for you, I am sure...”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n135\\nDoge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.\\n“I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,” said Harry. “I didn’t\\nrealize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.”\\n“As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. “Cer-\\ntainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth – and somehow,\\npeople never do seem to count Aberforth.”\\n“Speaking of the Daily Prophet... I don’t know whether you saw, Mr.\\nDoge –?”\\n“Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.”\\n“Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave\\nabout Dumbledore?”\\nDoge’s face flooded with angry color.\\n“Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate\\nterm, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I beca-\\nme rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you may\\nhave seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.”\\n“Well, in that interview,” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted that Pro-\\nfessor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.”\\n“Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once. “Not a word, Harry! Let\\nnothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!”\\nHarry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, not reassured, but\\nfrustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply\\nchoose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be sure, to\\nknow everything?\\nPerhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and\\nhurried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful –”\\nBut he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.\\n“Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!”\\nHarry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the\\nplumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand. “She’s wri-\\ntten a book about Dumbledore, you know!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n136\\n“Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just discussing –”\\n“You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred and seven!”\\nAnother redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed,\\nand Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped\\nherself down upon it between Doge and Harry.\\n“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry. “Now,\\nwhat were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know she’s written\\na biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I must remember to\\nplace an order at Flourish and Blotts!”\\nDoge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet\\nand clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took\\nanother large gulp of champagne, belched, and then said, “There’s no need\\nto look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and res-\\npectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about\\nAlbus!”\\n“Ill-informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish-colored again.\\n“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. “I noticed how\\nyou skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!”\\n“I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. “I assure you I was\\nwriting from the heart.”\\n“Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll still\\nthink he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib\\nsister!”\\n“Muriel!” exclaimed Doge.\\nA chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing\\nthrough Harry’s chest.\\n“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his sister was a Squib?\\nI thought she was ill?”\\n“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie Muriel, looking\\ndelighted at the effect she had produced. “Anyway, how could you expect\\nto know anything about it? It all happened years and years before you were\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n137\\neven thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive\\nthen never knew what really happened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out\\nwhat Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long\\ntime!”\\n“Untrue!” wheezed Doge. “Absolutely untrue!”\\n“He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without thinking,\\nstill cold inside.\\n“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little\\nin her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.\\n“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in a voice\\nstiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so dev-\\nastated by her death –”\\n“Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked Muriel. “Why did\\nhalf of us never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of\\nthe house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana\\nwas locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind\\nwhat was going on in his own house!”\\n“What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. “What is this?”\\nDoge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry.\\n“Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-\\nborn, though I heard she pretended otherwise –”\\n“She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,”\\nwhispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him.\\n“– proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been\\nmortified to produce a Squib –”\\n“Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge.\\n“So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hog-\\nwarts!” said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. “In our day, Squibs\\nwere often hushed up, though to take it to the extreme of actually impri-\\nsoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t exist –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n138\\n“I tell you, that’s not what happened!” said Doge, but Auntie Muriel\\nsteamrollered on, still addressing Harry.\\n“Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to\\nintegrate into the Muggle community... much kinder than trying to find\\nthem a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second\\nclass; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting\\nher daughter go to a Muggle school –”\\n“Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately. “Her health was always\\ntoo poor to permit her –”\\n“– to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. “And yet she was\\nnever taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!”\\n“Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether –”\\n“For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St.\\nMungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that\\nAriana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!”\\nDoge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to\\nbe enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne.\\nNumbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked\\nhim away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had\\nDumbledore’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her\\nlack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went\\noff to Hogwarts, to prove himself brilliant and talented?\\n“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,” Muriel resumed, “I’d have said that\\nit was she who finished off Ariana –”\\n“How can you, Muriel?” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own daugh-\\nter?\\nThink what you are saying!”\\n“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for\\nyears on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel. “But as I say, it doesn’t\\nfit, because Kendra died before Ariana – of what, nobody ever seemed\\nsure –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n139\\n“Oh, no doubt Ariana murdered her,” said Doge with a brave attempt at\\nscorn. “Why not?”\\n“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed\\nKendra in the struggle,” said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. “Shake your head\\nall you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?”\\n“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips. “And a more desperately\\nsad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken –”\\n“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’s nose\\nhalfway through the service?”\\nIf Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked\\nnow. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another\\nswig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.\\n“How do you –?” croaked Doge.\\n“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie Muriel\\nhappily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening\\nat the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted\\nthat it was all Albus’s fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in\\nthe face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and\\nthat’s odd enough in itself, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel\\nwith both hands tied behind his back.”\\nMuriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old scandals\\nseemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know\\nwhat to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did\\nwas sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly\\nbelieve that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was\\nhappening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something\\nodd about the story.\\n“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly as she\\nlowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter.\\nAll those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the\\nDumbledores – goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana busi-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n140\\nness, and it would fit!”\\n“Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge. “Bathilda\\nBagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A History of Magic?”\\nThe name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though\\nadmittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively.\\n“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at\\na life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.”\\n“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.\\n“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken\\nadvantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed on anything\\nBathilda may have said!”\\n“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter\\nknows them all,” said Auntie Muriel. “But even if Bathilda’s completely\\ncuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She\\nknew the Dumbledores for years... Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow,\\nI’d have thought.”\\nHarry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him\\non the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming\\neyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, “Bathilda Bagshot\\nlives in Godric’s Hollow?”\\n“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after\\nPercival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.”\\n“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?”\\n“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily.\\nHarry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told\\nHarry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow.\\nWhy? Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore’s mother and\\nsister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and\\nJames’s to do so? And he had never once told Harry... never bothered to\\nsay...\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n141\\nAnd why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself,\\nyet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this\\nplace and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely\\nnoticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione\\nhad appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him.\\n“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping off one of her shoes\\nand rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to find more butter-\\nbeers. It’s a bit odd, I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s father,\\nit looked like they’d been arguing –” She dropped her voice, staring at him.\\n“Harry, are you okay?”\\nHarry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter. At that moment,\\nsomething large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance\\nfloor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the\\nastonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in midd-\\nance. Then the Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep,\\nslow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.\\n“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n142\\nCHAPTER NINE\\nA PLACE TO HIDE\\nE\\nverything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped to their\\nfeet and drew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that some-\\nthing strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as\\nit vanished. Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the\\nPatronus had landed. Then somebody screamed.\\nHarry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests\\nwere sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective\\nenchantments around the Burrow had broken.\\n“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?”\\nAs they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and\\nmasked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their\\nwands raised, and heard both of them shout, “Protego!”, a cry that was\\nechoed on all sides –\\n“Ron! Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were\\nbuffeted by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they wer-\\nen’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a\\nprotective charm or something more sinister he did not know –\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n143\\nAnd then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione’s free arm, and\\nHarry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as dark-\\nness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione’s hand as he was\\nsqueezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the\\ndescending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself...\\n“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice.\\nHarry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the\\nwedding after all: They still seemed to be surrounded by people.\\n“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk, we need\\nto find somewhere for you to change.”\\nHarry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street\\nthronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twink-\\nling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry\\npubgoers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress\\nrobes.\\n“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told her, as a\\nyoung woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.\\n“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said\\nHarry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I kept it on me\\nand–”\\n“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,” said Her-\\nmione. “Just try and act naturally until – this will do.”\\nShe led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy\\nalleyway.\\n“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes...” said Harry, frowning\\nat Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag,\\nin which she was now rummaging.\\n“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s utter asto-\\nnishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks,\\nand finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.\\n“How the ruddy hell –?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n144\\n“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I think\\nI’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.”\\nShe gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo\\nhold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. “Oh, damn, that’ll\\nbe the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by sub-\\nject...\\nOh well... Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up\\nand change…”\\n“When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes.\\n“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you\\nknow, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack\\nthis morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here... I just had a\\nfeeling…”\\n“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes.\\n“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the\\nrobes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!”\\nHarry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up\\nover his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appre-\\nciate what had happened.\\n“The others – everyone at the wedding –”\\n“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s you they’re\\nafter, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going\\nback.”\\n“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to\\nargue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the Order was there, they’ll\\nlook after everyone.”\\nHarry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said,\\n“Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.\\n“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione.\\nThey moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n145\\na group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the\\npavement.\\n“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron asked\\nHermione.\\n“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in\\nthe Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.”\\n“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit – exposed?”\\n“Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other\\nside of the road started wolf-whistling at her. “We can hardly book rooms\\nat the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can\\nget in there... I suppose we could try my parents’ house, though I think\\nthere’s a chance they might check there Oh, I wish they’d shut up!”\\n“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was\\nyelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!”\\n“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his\\nmouth to shout back across the road. “Look, this will do, in here!”\\nIt was a small and shabby all-night café. A light layer of grease lay on all\\nthe Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a\\nbooth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back\\nto the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so freq-\\nuently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary;\\nwalking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he\\ncould feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to\\ntheir usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put\\nthem on again.\\nAfter a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from the\\nLeaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross –”\\n“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once.\\n“Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!”\\n“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what\\nelse do we need to know?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n146\\n“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!”\\nThey relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled\\nover and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it\\nwould have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered\\nthe café and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a\\nwhisper.\\n“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside.\\nOnce we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.”\\n“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron. “I’ve been\\npracticing and I think so,” said Hermione.\\n“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they might’ve\\nbeen arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added after one sip of the\\nfoamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as\\nshe shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders. The larger of the two\\nworkmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at\\nhim, waved her away. She stared, affronted.\\n“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron. “Her-\\nmione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?”\\n“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the\\nBurrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermione, reaching\\nfor her beaded bag.\\nThe two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them\\nwithout conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few\\nseconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing\\nHermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells\\nshattered the tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still\\ninvisible, yelled, “Stupefy!”\\nThe great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He\\nslumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast\\nthe spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip\\nand bound Ron head to foot – the waitress screamed and ran for the door –\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n147\\nHarry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face\\nwho had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and\\nhit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.\\n“Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry\\nwas standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall\\nand he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him.\\n“Petrificus Totalus!” screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the\\nDeath Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the\\nmess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from under-\\nneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling\\nall over.\\n“D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as\\nshe slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry,\\nRon, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!”\\nThe severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to\\nregain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the\\ndebris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.\\n“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,”\\nhe said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes\\nmoved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted pos-\\nters.\\nI think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.”\\n“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysterically.\\n“How did they find us? What are we going to do?”\\nSomehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head.\\n“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.”\\nHe looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock\\nclicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the café into darkness.\\nHarry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at\\nanother girl in the distance.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n148\\n“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry through\\nthe dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a\\ngood go just now.”\\nHermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head.\\n“We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better like that,\\nit’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be obvious we were\\nhere.”\\n“You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. “But I’ve\\nnever done a Memory Charm.”\\n“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.”\\nShe took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov’s\\nforehead and said, “Obliviate.”\\nAt once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.\\n“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care of the other\\none and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.”\\n“Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed café.\\n“Why?”\\n“Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they wake up\\nand find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed?”\\n“Oh right, yeah...”\\nRon struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from\\nhis pocket.\\n“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans,\\nthey’re tight.”\\n“Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out\\nof sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where\\nRon could stick his wand instead.\\nOnce the café was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the\\nDeath Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other.\\n“But how did they find us?” Hermione asked, looking from one inert man\\nto the other. “How did they know where we were?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n149\\nShe turned to Harry.\\n“You – you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you,\\nHarry?”\\n“He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wiz-\\narding law, you can’t put it on an adult.”\\n“As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death Eaters have\\nfound a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?”\\n“But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours.\\nWho’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?”\\nHermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really\\nhow the Death Eaters had found them?\\n“If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without us giving\\naway our position –” he began.\\n“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly.\\n“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us time to think things\\nthrough.”\\n“Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. The other two gaped.\\n“Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!”\\n“Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him – and even if they\\nhaven’t worked,” he pressed on as Hermione began to argue, “so what? I\\nswear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!”\\n“But –”\\n“Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got. Snape’s\\nonly one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole\\ncrowds of them on us wherever else we go.”\\nShe could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to.\\nWhile she unlocked the café door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release\\nthe café’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they reversed the spells\\nupon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death\\nEaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had\\nturned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n150\\nSeconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes:\\nThey were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby\\nsquare. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side.\\nNumber twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence\\nby Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking\\nevery few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They raced\\nup the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand.\\nThey heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the\\ndoor swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.\\nAs Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps\\nsprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It\\nlooked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the\\nhouse-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long\\ndark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius’s mother. The only thing that\\nwas out of place was the troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its\\nside as if Tonks had just knocked it over again.\\n“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, pointing toward\\nit.\\n“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured back. “So\\nwhere are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry asked. “Maybe\\nthey’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.\\nYet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door,\\nscared to move farther into the house.\\n“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step forward.\\n“Severus Snape?”\\nMad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three\\nof them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked Harry, before\\nsomething whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward\\non itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside\\nhis mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n151\\nThe other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensa-\\ntion. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, “That m-must\\nhave b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!”\\nGingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the\\nshadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another\\nword, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible:\\nHermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the\\ngray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair\\nand beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye\\nsockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm,\\npointing at Harry.\\n“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occu-\\nrred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you –”\\nOn the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing,\\nhis eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the\\nfloor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking\\nfrom head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, “It’s all\\nrright... It’s g-gone…”\\nDust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs.\\nBlack continued to scream.\\n“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my\\nfathers –”\\n“SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang\\nand a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her.\\n“That... that was...” Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet.\\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just something to\\nscare Snape.”\\nHad it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-\\nfigure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still\\ntingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to\\nreveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n152\\nskirting board.\\n“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered Her-\\nmione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.”\\nNothing happened.\\n“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What was that\\nsupposed to do?”\\n“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather crossly. “That was a\\nspell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody here except us!”\\n“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which\\nthe corpse-figure had risen.\\n“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and\\nshe led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor.\\nHermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering\\nslightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tight-\\nly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet\\ncurtain aside an inch.\\n“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think, if Harry still\\nhad a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know they can’t get in\\nthe house, but – what’s up, Harry?”\\nHarry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned again as something\\nflashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow\\nand felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and\\nbrief as an electric shock.\\n“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did you see him\\nat my place?”\\n“No, I just felt anger – he’s really angry –”\\n“But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. “What else? Didn’t\\nyou see anything? Was he cursing someone?”\\n“No, I just felt anger – I couldn’t tell –”\\nHarry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in\\na frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I thought that\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n153\\nconnection had closed!”\\n“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which\\nmade it hard to concentrate. “I – I think it’s started opening again whenever\\nhe loses control, that’s how it used to –”\\n“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly. “Harry,\\nDumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut\\nit down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise\\nVoldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember –”\\n“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth; he did\\nnot need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame\\nconnection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in\\nSirius’s death. He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and\\nfelt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing\\nagainst the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building\\nand he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.\\nHe turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old\\ntapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked:\\nHarry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar\\nthrough the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them,\\nwhere it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father.\\n“Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.”\\nThe Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a\\nwhimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him,\\ngripping his arm.\\n“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed\\nand hugged her.\\n“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I –”\\n“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. “It’s\\nyour family, ‘course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way.” He thought of\\nGinny. “I do feel the same way.”\\nThe pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n154\\ngarden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, “I don’t want to be\\non my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here\\ntonight?”\\nHe heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer: He had to\\nsuccumb.\\n“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without\\nrunning.\\nHe barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he\\ngrasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of\\nagony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a\\nlong room lit only by firelight, and the great blond Death Eater on the floor,\\nscreaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand\\noutstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.\\n“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort\\nis not sure that he will forgive this time... You called me back for this, to\\ntell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste\\nof our displeasure... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!”\\nA log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified,\\npointed white face – with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew\\nheaving breaths and opened his eyes.\\nHe was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches\\nfrom one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat\\nup. Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes.\\nHarry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was\\nnow being put by Voldemort.\\nThere was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione’s\\nvoice rang out.\\n“Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.”\\n“Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he\\nstood up to let her in.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n155\\nCHAPTER TEN\\nKREACHER’S TALE\\nH\\narry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the draw-\\ning room floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: It\\nwas the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn,\\nand everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione’s slow, deep breath-\\ning. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside\\nhim. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the\\ncushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm\\ncurved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s. Harry wondered whether\\nthey had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely\\nlonely.\\nHe looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less\\nthan twenty-four hours ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the ent-\\nrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a life-\\ntime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor and he\\nthought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore\\nhad left him... Dumbledore...\\nThe grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s death felt different\\nnow. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n156\\nhave nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the\\nwizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen?\\nHad he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it\\ndid not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being\\nimprisoned and hidden?\\nHarry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never\\nmentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation\\nin Dumbledore’s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn’t\\nDumbledore told him? Why hadn’t he explained? Had Dumbledore actually\\ncared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be\\npolished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?\\nHarry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for\\ncompany. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of\\nhis sleeping bag, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the\\nlanding he whispered, “Lumos,” and started to climb the stairs by wand-\\nlight.\\nOn the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept\\nlast time they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood\\nopen and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the\\noverturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the\\nOrder had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty\\nfrom this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered\\nto the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s\\ngreat-greatgrandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of\\nmuddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the\\nheadmaster’s study at Hogwarts.\\nHarry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing, where\\nthere were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading\\nSIRIUS. Harry had never entered his godfather’s bedroom before. He push-\\ned open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible.\\nThe room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n157\\nlarge bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long\\nvelvet curtains, and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs\\nstill resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in frostlike drips. A fine film\\nof dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s\\nweb stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden\\nwardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying\\nof disturbed mice.\\nThe teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and\\npictures that little of the walls’ silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could\\nonly assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent\\nSticking Charm that kept them on the wall, because he was sure they would\\nnot have appreciated their eldest son’s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to\\nhave gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large\\nGryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to underline his difference\\nfrom all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of\\nMuggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several\\nposters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles\\nbecause they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles\\nand glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast to the only Wiz-\\narding photograph on the walls, which was a picture of four Hogwarts stu-\\ndents standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera.\\nWith a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; his untidy black hair\\nstuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was\\nSirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and\\nhappier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew,\\nmore than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at\\nhis inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that\\nJames and Sirius had been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little\\nshabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding\\nhimself liked and included... or was it simply because Harry knew how it\\nhad been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n158\\nwall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would\\nnot budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from\\nredecorating his room.\\nHarry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brighter:\\nA shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered\\nover the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom had been searched too, although\\nits contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless.\\nA few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with\\ntheir covers, and sundry pages littered the floor.\\nHarry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined\\nthem. He recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by\\nBathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance\\nmanual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out.\\nDear Padfoot,\\nThank you thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It was his\\nfavorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy\\nbroomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I’m enclosing a\\npicture so you can see.\\nYou know it only rises about two feet off the ground, but he\\nnearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent\\nme for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought\\nit was so funny, says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player,\\nbut we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we\\ndon’t take our eyes off him when he gets going.\\nWe had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who\\nhas always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so\\nsorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and\\nHarry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway! James\\nis getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I\\ncan tell – also, Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n159\\nchance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him\\nup so much. Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he seemed\\ndown, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I\\ncried all evening when I heard.\\nBathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing with\\nthe most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I’m not sure he’d be\\npleased if he knew! I don’t know how much to believe, actually,\\nbecause it seems incredible that Dumbledore.\\nHarry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, hold-\\ning the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of\\nquiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal measure through his\\nveins. Lurching to the bed, he sat down.\\nHe read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he\\nhad done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself.\\nShe had made her “g”s the same way he did: He searched through the letter\\nfor every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from\\nbehind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter\\nhad lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this\\nparchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him,\\nHarry, her son.\\nImpatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter,\\nthis time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-\\nremembered voice.\\nThey had had a cat... perhaps it had perished, like his parents, at Godric’s\\nHollow... or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it... Sirius had\\nbought him his first broomstick... His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot;\\nhad Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility\\nCloak... There was something funny there...\\nHarry paused, pondering his mother’s words. Why had Dumbledore\\ntaken James’s Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his head-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n160\\nmaster telling him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible.”\\nPerhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and\\nDumbledore had acted as carrier? Harry passed on...\\nWormy was here... Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed “down,” had he?\\nWas he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time?\\nAnd finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dum-\\nbledore.\\nIt seems incredible that Dumbledore –\\nThat Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would\\nseem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks\\nin a Transfiguration test, for instance, or had taken up goat-charming like\\nAberforth...\\nHarry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter\\nwas here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them, in his eagerness, with\\nas little consideration as the original searcher; he pulled open drawers,\\nshook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the ward-\\nrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair.\\nAt last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn\\npiece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved\\nto be most of the photograph Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired\\nbaby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with\\nlaughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing\\nafter him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and\\ncontinued to look for the second sheet.\\nAfter another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to conclude that\\nthe rest of his mother’s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen\\nyears that had elapsed since it had been written, or had it been taken by\\nwhoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time\\nlooking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His\\ntoy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters...\\nThe only potentially useful thing he could see here was possible informa-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n161\\ntion on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore – what?\\n“Harry? Harry! Harry!”\\n“I’m here!” he called. “What’s happened?”\\nThere was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst\\ninside.\\n“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breathlessly.\\nShe turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found him!”\\nRon’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. “Good!\\nTell him from me he’s a git!”\\n“Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you\\ncome up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room. “What have\\nyou been doing?”\\n“Look what I’ve just found.”\\nHe held out his mother’s letter. Hermione took it and read it while Harry\\nwatched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him.\\n“Oh, Harry...”\\n“And there’s this too.”\\nHe handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby\\nzooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.\\n“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not\\nhere.” Hermione glanced around.\\n“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?”\\n“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.\\n“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed.\\nWhat were they after, do you think?”\\n“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”\\n“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was in the\\nOrder, wasn’t he?”\\n“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about inform-\\nation on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You\\nknow this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n162\\n“Who?”\\n“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of –”\\n“A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your\\nparents knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.”\\n“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow,\\nRon’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dum-\\nbledore’s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?”\\nThere was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave\\nhim for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and\\ntucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at\\nher and give himself away.\\n“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and\\nDumbledore too,” said Hermione. “But that wouldn’t really help us in our\\nsearch for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she rushed\\non, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m\\nscared, I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It\\njust makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where\\nyour parents are buried, I’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.”\\n“It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her. “Muriel said\\nstuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth “\\nHe told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had\\nfinished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you,\\nHarry–”\\n“I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true\\nor–”\\n“Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old\\nwoman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You\\nknew Dumbledore!”\\n“I thought I did,” he muttered.\\n“But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about\\nyou! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n163\\nDumbledore?”\\nHe looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was\\nagain: Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so\\ndetermined that he should not get it?\\n“Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione suggested after a little\\npause. “Find something for breakfast?”\\nHe agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past\\nthe second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paint-\\nwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He paused at\\nthe top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous little sign, neatly lettered\\nby hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his\\nbedroom door:\\nDo Not Enter\\nWithout the Express Permission of Regulus Arcturus Black\\nExcitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why.\\nHe read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below\\nhim. “Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm.\\n“Come back up here.”\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n“R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.”\\nThere was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. “In your\\nmum’s letter? But I didn’t see –”\\nHarry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She read it, then clu-\\ntched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced.\\n“Sirius’s brother?” she whispered.\\n“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry, “Sirius told me about him, he joined\\nup when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave – so\\nthey killed him.”\\n“That fits!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater he had access to\\nVoldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n164\\nbring Voldemort down!”\\nShe released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “Ron! RON!\\nGet up here, quick!”\\nRon appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand.\\n“What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I –”\\nHe frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, to which Hermione was\\nsilently pointing.\\n“What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus... Regu-\\nlus... R.A.B.! The locket – you don’t reckon –?”\\n“Let’s find out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione\\npointed her wand at the handle and said, “Alohomora.” There was a click,\\nand the door swung open.\\nThey moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus’s bed-\\nroom was slightly smaller than Sirius’s, though it had the same sense of\\nformer grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from\\nthe rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. The\\nSlytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed,\\nthe walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly paint-\\ned over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this was\\na collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a\\nragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.\\n“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems to have been a\\nfan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters “\\nA little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the\\nclippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph; a Hogwarts\\nQuidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer\\nand saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was\\ninstantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He\\nhad the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he\\nwas smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.\\n“He played Seeker,” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n165\\n“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort’s\\npress clippings.\\n“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the Seeker...\\nNever mind,” said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening: Ron was\\non his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around\\nthe room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet again, some-\\nbody had searched before them. The drawers’ contents had been turned over\\nrecently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills,\\nout-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a\\nrecently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the\\ndrawer.\\n“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers\\non his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!”\\nNothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded\\ncurtains, looked disappointed.\\n“Is that it, then? It’s not here?”\\n“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,” said Her-\\nmione. “Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.”\\n“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry, remem-\\nbering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.\\n“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron.\\n“We search manually,” said Hermione.\\n“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his\\nexamination of the curtains.\\nThey combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were\\nforced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there.\\nThe sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy\\nlanding windows.\\n“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said Hermione in a\\nrallying tone as they walked back downstairs: As Harry and Ron had beco-\\nme more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined. “Whe-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n166\\nther he’d managed to destroy it or not, he’d want to keep it hidden from\\nVoldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get\\nrid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone\\nand those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them\\nthere to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it\\nat... at...”\\nHarry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair,\\nwith the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated; her eyes had\\neven drifted out of focus.\\n“... at the time,” she finished in a whisper. “Something wrong?” asked\\nRon.\\n“There was a locket.”\\n“What?” said Harry and Ron together.\\n“In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we...\\nwe...”\\nHarry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his sto-\\nmach. He remembered: He had even handled the thing as they passed it\\naround, each trying in turn to prise it open. It had been tossed into a sack of\\nrubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that\\nhad made everyone sleepy...\\n“Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said Harry. It was the\\nonly chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling\\nto it until forced to let go. “He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in\\nthe kitchen. C’mon.”\\nHe ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering\\nalong in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of\\nSirius’s mother as they passed through the hall.\\n“Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!” she screamed after them as they dashed down\\ninto the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them.\\nHarry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Krea-\\ncher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n167\\nblankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but they were no longer\\nglittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was\\nan old copy of Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to\\nbelieve his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead\\nmouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw\\nhimself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes.\\n“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, “Krea-\\ncher!”\\nThere was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly\\ninherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty\\nfireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds,\\nwhite hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still wearing\\nthe filthy rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look\\nhe bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had\\naltered no more than his outfit.\\n“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed low,\\nmuttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with the blood-\\ntraitor Weasley and the Mudblood –”\\n“I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or ‘Mudblood,’” growled\\nHarry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and blood-\\nshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius\\nto Voldemort.\\n“I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as\\nhe looked down at the elf, “and I order you to answer it truthfully. Under-\\nstand?”\\n“Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his lips\\nmoving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden\\nto utter.\\n“Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs,\\n“there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out.\\nDid you steal it back?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n168\\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to\\nlook Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.”\\n“Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked\\ngleeful.\\nKreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions\\nto his next word.\\n“Gone.”\\n“Gone?” echoed Harry, elation flooding out of him. “What do you mean,\\nit’s gone?”\\nThe elf shivered. He swayed.\\n“Kreacher,” said Harry fiercely, “I order you –”\\n“Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. “Mund-\\nungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my\\nMistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the\\nfamily crest, and – and –”\\nKreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and falling\\nrapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.\\n“– and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket, Kreacher did wrong, Krea-\\ncher failed in his orders!”\\nHarry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in\\nthe grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione’s\\nscream mingled with Kreacher’s, but Harry bellowed louder than both of\\nthem: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!”\\nHe felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone\\nfloor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes.\\n“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered.\\n“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneeling besi-\\nde the elf. “I don’t think so. Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you\\nknow Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?”\\n“Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and\\ninto his mouth full of graying teeth. “Kreacher saw him coming out of Krea-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n169\\ncher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s treasures. Kreacher told\\nthe sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran…”\\n“You called the locket ‘Master Regulus’s,’” said Harry. “Why? Where\\ndid it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up\\nand tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus\\nhad to do with it!”\\nThe elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees,\\nand began to rock backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was\\nmuffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen.\\n“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke\\nmy Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper\\npride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his\\npure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring\\nthe wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns... and\\nwhen he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So\\nproud, so proud, so happy to serve...\\n“And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to\\nthe kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And\\nMaster Regulus said... he said...\\nThe old elf rocked faster than ever.\\n“...he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.”\\n“Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and\\nHermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.\\n“Oh yes,” moaned Kreacher. “And Master Regulus had volunteered\\nKreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for\\nKreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to\\ndo... and then to c-come home.”\\nKreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs.\\n“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher\\nwhat they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea.\\nAnd beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n170\\nlake...”\\nThe hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. Kreacher’s croaking\\nvoice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He saw what had\\nhappened as clearly as though he had been present.\\n“... There was a boat...”\\nOf course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and\\ntiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island\\nin the center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses\\nsurrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf...\\n“There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made\\nKreacher drink it…”\\nThe elf quaked from head to foot.\\n“Kreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible things Kreacher’s\\ninsides burned... Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried\\nfor his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed He made Kreacher\\ndrink all the potion... He dropped a locket into the empty basin He filled it\\nwith more potion.\\n“And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island…”\\nHarry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort’s white, snakelike\\nface vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing\\nelf whose death would occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to\\nthe desperate thirst that the burning potion caused its victim... But here,\\nHarry’s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher\\nhad escaped.\\n“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank\\nfrom the black lake... and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and\\ndragged Kreacher under the surface…”\\n“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear\\nhimself whispering.\\nKreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great, blood-\\nshot eyes.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n171\\n“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said. “I know – but\\nhow did you escape the Inferi?” Kreacher did not seem to understand.\\n“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated. “I know,\\nbut–”\\n“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He Disapparated!”\\n“But... you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said Harry,\\n“otherwise Dumbledore –”\\n“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron. “I mean, they can\\nApparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t.”\\nThere was silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have\\nmade such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her\\nvoice was icy.\\n“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves\\nfar beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like\\nanimals...\\nIt would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he\\ndidn’t.”\\n“The house-elf’s highest law is his Master’s bidding,” intoned Kreacher.\\n“Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home “\\n“Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” said Hermione\\nkindly. “You didn’t disobey orders at all!”\\nKreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.\\n“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked. “What did Regu-\\nlus say when you told him what had happened?”\\n“Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked Kreacher.\\n“Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house.\\nAnd then... it was a little while later... Master Regulus came to find Kreacher\\nin his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually\\nwas, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell... and he asked Kreacher to\\ntake him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark\\nLord…”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n172\\nAnd so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the\\nfrightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius...\\nKreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground\\ncavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; this time it was his beloved Regulus\\nwho sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison...\\n“And he made you drink the potion?” said Harry, disgusted.\\nBut Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s hands leapt to her\\nmouth: She seemed to have understood something.\\n“M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark\\nLord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike\\nnose. “And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to\\nswitch the lockets…”\\nKreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard\\nto understand him.\\n“And he ordered – Kreacher to leave – without him. And he told Kreacher\\n– to go home – and never to tell my Mistress – what he had done – but to\\ndestroy – the first locket. And he drank – all the potion – and Kreacher swa-\\npped the lockets – and watched... as Master Regulus... was dragged beneath\\nthe water... and…”\\n“Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her\\nknees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet,\\ncringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.\\n“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his\\nMistress say?”\\n“I told you not to call her ‘Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, but the elf was\\nalready punishing himself: He fell to the ground and banged his forehead\\non the floor.\\n“Stop him – stop him!” Hermione cried. “Oh, don’t you see now how\\nsick it is, the way they’ve got to obey?”\\n“Kreacher – stop, stop!” shouted Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n173\\nThe elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening\\naround his snout, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he\\nhad struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears.\\nHarry had never seen anything so pitiful.\\n“So you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly, for he was deter-\\nmined to know the full story. “And you tried to destroy it?”\\n“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the elf. “Krea-\\ncher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would\\nwork...\\nSo many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to\\ndestroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open... Kreacher punished\\nhimself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed\\nto obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his Mistress was\\nmad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher\\ncould not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-\\nforbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave…”\\nKreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words.\\nTears flowed down Hermione’s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she\\ndid not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher’s,\\nlooked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying to\\nclear it.\\n“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally. “Voldemort tried to\\nkill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy\\nto betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and\\nBellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them…”\\n“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes\\non the back of her hand. “He’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even\\nbrutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the\\ncommon way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s\\nloyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and\\nRegulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their be-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n174\\nliefs. I know what you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to pro-\\ntest, “that Regulus changed his mind... but he doesn’t seem to have ex-\\nplained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and\\nRegulus’s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line.\\nRegulus was trying to protect them all.”\\n“Sirius –”\\n“Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking like\\nthat, you know it’s true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when\\nSirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection.\\nI’m sure ‘Miss Cissy’ and ‘Miss Bella’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher\\nwhen he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they\\nwanted to know. I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they\\ntreat houseelves. Well, Voldemort did... and so did Sirius.”\\nHarry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he\\nremembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius’s\\ndeath: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as\\nacute as a human’s...\\n“Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it, er please sit\\nup.”\\nIt was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence.\\nThen he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles\\ninto his eyes like a small child.\\n“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry. He glan-\\nced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at\\nthe same time, he could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the\\nchange in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encou-\\nragingly.\\n“Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We\\nneed to find out where the locket – where Master Regulus’s locket is. It’s\\nreally important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we\\nwant to – er – ensure that he didn’t die in vain.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n175\\nKreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry. “Find Mundungus\\nFletcher?” he croaked.\\n“And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. “Do you think\\nyou could do that for us?”\\nAs Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration.\\nHe pulled out Hagrid’s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute\\nlocket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort.\\n“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, pressing the locket into\\nthe elf’s hand. “This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure he’d want you to\\nhave it as a token of gratitude for what you –”\\n“Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a\\nhowl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground.\\nIt took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so\\novercome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own\\nthat he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was\\nable to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched\\nhim tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they\\nwould make its protection their first priority while he was away. He then\\nmade two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm\\nin Hermione’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful\\nsalute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n176\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\nTHE BRIBE\\nI\\nf Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that\\nthe capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled\\nthe house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did\\nnot return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt\\ndiscouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread,\\nupon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations,\\ndid nothing to help.\\nKreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. How-\\never, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve,\\nand they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house\\nthat they could not see.\\n“Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched\\nfrom the drawing room windows. “Reckon they know we’re in here?”\\n“I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked frightened, “or\\nthey’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?”\\n“D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody’s\\ncurse?” asked Ron.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n177\\n“Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how\\nto get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we\\nturn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.”\\n“How do they –?” began Harry.\\n“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They’ll know\\nSirius left you the place.”\\nThe presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood\\ninside number twelve. They had not heard a word from anyone beyond\\nGrimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting\\nto tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of play-\\ning with the Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly infuriated Her-\\nmione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales\\nof Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing\\non and off.\\n“Will you stop it!” she cried on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence,\\nas all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again.\\n“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the\\nlights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!”\\n“Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?”\\n“What, like reading kids’ stories?”\\n“Dumbledore left me this book, Ron –”\\n“– and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!”\\nUnable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed\\nby either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept\\nvisiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to\\nreappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard\\na tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.\\nEvery nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved\\ninto the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door\\nopened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure\\nedged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n178\\nforward, and Moody’s voice asked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust figure\\nrose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.\\n“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.\\nThe jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to\\nmake out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind.\\nHarry pointed his wand into the middle of it. “Don’t move!”\\nHe had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the\\ncurtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and\\nfilth dishonoring my house –”\\nRon and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands\\npointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in\\nthe hall below.\\n“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!”\\n“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs.\\nBlack instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell.\\nRon too lowered his wand, but Harry did not.\\n“Show yourself!” he called back.\\nLupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture\\nof surrender.\\n“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of\\nthe four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually\\nknown as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which\\ntakes the form of a stag.”\\n“Oh, all right,” said Harry, lowering his wand, “but I had to check, didn’t\\nI?”\\n“Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite\\nagree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick\\nto lower your defenses.”\\nThey ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling\\ncloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.\\n“No sign of Severus, then?” he asked.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n179\\n“No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?”\\n“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of\\nDeath Eaters in the square outside –”\\n“We know –”\\n“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door\\nto be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or\\nI’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere\\nthat’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot\\nto tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.”\\nThey descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at\\nthe grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the\\nstark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a\\nfew butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down.\\n“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death\\nEater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here after the wedd-\\ning?”\\n“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a\\ncafé on Tottenham Court Road.”\\nLupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.\\n“What?”\\nThey explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin look-\\ned aghast.\\n“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone\\nwho Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!”\\n“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham\\nCourt Road at the time, does it?” said Harry.\\n“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could still\\nhave the Trace on him?”\\n“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relie-\\nved. “Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he\\nstill had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n180\\nhave tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worry-\\ning.”\\nHe looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question\\ncould wait.\\n“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since\\nRon’s dad told us the family were safe.”\\n“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most of\\nthe wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.”\\n“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected Hermione.\\n“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,”\\nsaid Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you\\nwere there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your\\nwhereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t\\ngive you away.”\\nHarry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the\\nmingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much,\\nbut if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect\\nHarry.\\n“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lupin went\\non. “They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close – and then they\\ninterrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get\\ninformation on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew\\nthat you had been there.\\n“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death\\nEaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the\\ncountry. No deaths,” he added quickly, forestalling the question, “but they\\nwere rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know\\nhe wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family.\\nAgain, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They’re all\\nright – shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.”\\n“The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?” Harry asked,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n181\\nremembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in\\nTonks’s parents’ garden.\\n“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the\\nfull might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin. “They’ve got the\\npower to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They\\nmanaged to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and\\nonce inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.”\\n“And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s where-\\nabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.\\n“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the\\nDaily Prophet.\\n“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll know sooner\\nor later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.”\\nHarry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled\\nthe front page. He read the headline over it:\\nWANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nRon and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He\\npushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew\\nwhat it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when\\nDumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had\\nalready told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the\\nplace moments after Dumbledore had fallen.\\n“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said.\\n“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked Her-\\nmione furiously.\\nLupin nodded.\\n“But surely people realize what’s going on?”\\n“The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin. “The official\\nversion of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n182\\nPius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.”\\n“Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?” asked Ron.\\nLupin laughed.\\n“He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why should\\nhe sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care\\nof everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond\\nthe Ministry.\\n“Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has\\nbeen such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and\\nmany are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the\\npoint: They whisper. They daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom\\nto trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and\\ntheir families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game.\\nDeclaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked\\nhas created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.”\\n“And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said Harry, “involves\\nwarning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?”\\n“That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a masterstroke. Now\\nthat Dumbledore is dead, you – the Boy Who Lived – were sure to be the\\nsymbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by\\nsuggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s death, Voldemort has not\\nonly set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many\\nwho would have defended you.\\n“Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.”\\nLupin pointed at the Daily Prophet.\\n“Look at page two.”\\nHermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she\\nhad worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art.\\n“‘Muggle-born Register,’” she read aloud. “‘The Ministry of Magic is\\nundertaking a survey of so-called “Muggle-borns,” the better to understand\\nhow they came to possess magical secrets.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n183\\n“‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals\\nthat magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards repro-\\nduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called\\nMuggleborn is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.\\n“‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power,\\nand to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to\\npresent themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born\\nRegistration Commission.’”\\n“People won’t let this happen,” said Ron.\\n“It is happening, Ron,” said Lupin. “Muggle-borns are being rounded up\\nas we speak.”\\n“But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?” said Ron. “It’s men-\\ntal, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?”\\n“I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have\\nat least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained\\nyour magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.”\\nRon glanced at Hermione, then said, “What if purebloods and half-bloods\\nswear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione’s\\nmy cousin –”\\nHermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. “Thank you,\\nRon, but I couldn’t let you –”\\n“You won’t have a choice,” said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back.\\n“I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.”\\nHermione gave a shaky laugh.\\n“Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in\\nthe country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would\\nbe different. What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?” she asked Lupin.\\n“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he\\nreplied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never\\nobligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has\\nbeen educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n184\\nhome or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have\\nthe whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s\\nalso another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be\\ngiven Blood Status – meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that\\nthey are of Wizard descent – before they are allowed to attend.”\\nHarry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds\\nwould be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks, unaware that\\nthey would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again\\neither. “It’s... it’s...” he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to\\nthe horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, “I know.”\\nLupin hesitated.\\n“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under\\nthe impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.”\\n“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re\\ncoming with me.”\\n“Can you confide in me what the mission is?”\\nHarry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying\\nhair, and wished that he could return a different answer.\\n“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I\\ncan.”\\n“I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed. “But I might\\nstill be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could\\ncome with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me\\nexactly what you were up to.”\\nHarry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be\\nable to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the\\ntime he could not imagine.\\nHermione, however, looked puzzled. “But what about Tonks?” she\\nasked. “What about her?” said Lupin.\\n“Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married! How does she feel\\nabout you going away with us?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n185\\n“Tonks will be perfectly safe,” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her parents’\\nhouse.”\\nThere was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold. There\\nwas also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her\\nparents’ house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry\\nknew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.\\n“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all right... you know\\n... between you and –”\\n“Everything is fine, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly.\\nHermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and emba-\\nrrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit\\nsomething unpleasant, “Tonks is going to have a baby.”\\n“Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione. “Excellent!” said Ron enthu-\\nsiastically. “Congratulations,” said Harry.\\nLupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said,\\n“So... do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that\\nDumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe\\nthat we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.”\\nRon and Hermione both looked at Harry.\\n“Just – just to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave Tonks at her parents’\\nhouse and come away with us?”\\n“She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” said Lupin. He\\nspoke with a finality bordering on indifference. “Harry, I’m sure James\\nwould have wanted me to stick with you.”\\n“Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father would\\nhave wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.”\\nLupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have\\ndropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been\\nbidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes swiveled backward and\\nforward from Harry to Lupin.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n186\\n“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last. “Explain, then,” said Harry.\\nLupin swallowed.\\n“I – I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better\\njudgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.”\\n“I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run\\noff with us?”\\nLupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared\\nat them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the\\nwolf upon his human face.\\n“Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child?\\nI should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!” Lupin kicked\\naside the chair he had overturned.\\n“You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s\\nprotection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world\\nsees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely\\ntalk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted\\nby our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a were-\\nwolf? And the child – the child –”\\nLupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.\\n“My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it – how\\ncan I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition\\nto an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will\\nbe better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always\\nbe ashamed!”\\n“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say that – how\\ncould any child be ashamed of you?”\\n“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pretty ashamed of\\nhim.”\\nHarry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled\\nhim to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.\\n“If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,” Harry said, “what will\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n187\\nthey do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order? My father died\\ntrying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon\\nyour kid to go on an adventure with us?”\\n“How – how dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about a desire for – for\\ndanger or personal glory – how dare you suggest such a –”\\n“I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,” Harry said. “You fancy stepp-\\ning into Sirius’s shoes –”\\n“Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into\\nLupin’s livid face.\\n“I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man who taught me to\\nfight dementors – a coward.”\\nLupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own;\\nthere was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as\\nhe slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail\\nof Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door.\\n“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did not res-\\npond.\\nA moment later they heard the front door slam. “Harry!” wailed Her-\\nmione. “How could you?”\\n“It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swelling\\nwhere his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking.\\n“Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione. “Don’t you start\\non her!” snarled Ron.\\n“No – no – we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, launching herself between\\nthem.\\n“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron told Harry.\\n“He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images were racing each\\nother through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore sus-\\npended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother’s voice,\\nbegging for mercy...\\n“Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless – unless they’ve\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n188\\ngot to.”\\n“Harry –” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shru-\\ngged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured.\\nHe had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance\\nabout James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face\\nseemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse.\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking\\nat each other behind his back, communicating silently.\\nHe turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each\\nother. “I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.”\\n“No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once. “But he’s acting like one.”\\n“All the same...” said Hermione.\\n“I know,” said Harry. “But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be\\nworth it, won’t it?”\\nHe could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympa-\\nthetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father.\\nWould James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he\\nhave been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?\\nThe silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and\\nwith Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin\\nhad brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the\\nceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the\\npaper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his\\nmind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron\\nand Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of\\nthe Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at\\nhim. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photo-\\ngraph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the\\nwords: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding new-\\nborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.\\nHis attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dum-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n189\\nbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed\\nto twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was little\\nlonger than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother,\\nKendra, had jet-black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved\\nquality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d seen as\\nhe studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally com-\\nposed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching\\nlacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus\\nlooked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike,\\nfor this was before Albus’s nose had been broken and before he started\\nwearing glasses.\\nThe family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of\\nthe newspaper. Baby Ariana’s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry\\nlooked above the picture and saw the headline:\\nEXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING\\nBIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nby Rita Skeeter\\nThinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already\\ndid, Harry began to read:\\nProud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to\\nremain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-\\npublicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore\\ndecided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the\\nvillage that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s\\nstrange escape from You-KnowWho.\\nLike Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was home to a\\nnumber of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them,\\nshe would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she\\nhad faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n190\\nfriendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon\\nensured that her family was left well alone.\\n“Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome\\nher with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda\\nBagshot. “The first year they were there I only ever saw the two\\nboys. Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I hadn’t been\\npicking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved\\nin, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden.\\nWalked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then\\ntook her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.”\\nIt seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s Hollow was\\nthe perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something\\nshe had probably been planning for years. The timing was signi-\\nficant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from\\nsight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic\\nwill have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers\\nAriana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical\\nability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to\\nhide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of\\nadmitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the\\nfriends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make\\nimprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who\\nhenceforth knew of Ariana’s existence could be counted upon to\\nkeep the secret, including her two brothers, who deflected awk-\\nward questions with the answer their mother had taught them:\\n“My sister is too frail for school.”\\nNext week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts – the Prizes and\\nthe Pretense.\\nHarry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel\\nworse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n191\\nWas it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow,\\neven if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him; he wanted to visit the place\\nwhere he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process\\nof lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a\\ndeafening crack echoed around the kitchen.\\nFor the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher.\\nHis immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for\\na split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had\\nappeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as Krea-\\ncher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher\\nhas returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.”\\nMundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however,\\nwas too quick for him.\\n“Expelliarmus!”\\nMundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-\\neyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him and Mund-\\nungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.\\n“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s\\ngrip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ‘ouse-elf on me, what are you play-\\ning at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or –”\\n“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry. He threw\\naside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his\\nknees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron\\ngot up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mun-\\ndungus’s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke: His\\nhair was matted and his robes stained.\\n“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,” croaked\\nthe elf. “Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and\\naccomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.”\\n“You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf bowed low.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n192\\n“Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told Mundungus, who\\nshouted at once,\\n“I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I\\nnever volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’ You-Know-Who\\ncome flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I didn’t\\nwanna do it –”\\n“For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,” said Her-\\nmione.\\n“Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ‘eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pre-\\ntended I was up for killing meself –”\\n“We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,” said Harry,\\nmoving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. “We\\nalready knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.”\\n“Well then, why the ‘ell am I being ‘unted down by ‘ouse-elves? Or is\\nthis about them goblets again? I ain’t got none of ‘em left, or you could ‘ave\\n‘em –”\\n“It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,” said\\nHarry. “Shut up and listen.”\\nIt felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could\\ndemand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now so close to the\\nbridge of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to\\nkeep it in view.\\n“When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” Harry began,\\nbut Mundungus interrupted him again.\\n“Sirius never cared about any of the junk –”\\nThere was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper, an\\nechoing clang, and a shriek of agony: Kreacher had taken a run at Mundun-\\ngus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.\\n“Call ‘im off, call ‘im off, ‘e should be locked up!” screamed Mundun-\\ngus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.\\n“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry.\\x0cJ.K.

There\\nwas a locket there.” Harry’s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron\\nand Hermione’s tension and excitement too. “What did you do with it?”\\n“Why?” asked Mundungus. “Is it valuable?”\\n“You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione.\\n“No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering whether he should\\nhave asked more money for it.”\\n“More?” said Mundungus. “That wouldn’t have been effing difficult...\\nbleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I’ve\\ngot a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna\\nfine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let\\nme off that time, and to fink meself lucky.”\\n“Who was this woman?” asked Harry. “I dunno, some Ministry hag.”\\nMundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. “Little woman.\\nBow on top of ‘er head.”\\nHe frowned and then added, “Looked like a toad.”\\nHarry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red\\nsparks into his eyebrows, which ignited.\\n“Aguamenti!” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her\\nwand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n194\\nHarry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and Her-\\nmione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling\\nagain.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n195\\nCHAPTER TWELVE\\nMAGIC IS MIGHT\\nA\\ns August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Gri-\\nmmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inha-\\nbitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding\\nhouses, and nor was number twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Gri-\\nmmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the num-\\nbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.\\nAnd yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to\\nfind the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two\\npeople arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed,\\nthan to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watc-\\nhing the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two\\ndays running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal cloth-\\ning. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers\\nand took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back,\\nwondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat.\\nThe watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil.\\nOccasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen\\nsomething interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n196\\nOn the first day of September there were more people lurking in the\\nsquare than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and\\nwatchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for\\nwhich they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bring-\\ning with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there\\noccurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have\\nseen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his\\nclosest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later\\nthey had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated\\nand disappointed.\\nMeanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He\\nhad nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the\\nfront door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse\\nof his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind\\nhim, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried\\nalong the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen\\ncopy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.\\nThe usual low whisper of “Severus Snape?” greeted him, the chill wind\\nswept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment.\\n“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as\\nthe dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the\\nstairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud,\\nbefore calling, “I’ve got news, and you won’t like it.”\\nThe kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone: Copp-\\ner pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop\\ngleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light\\nfrom a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing\\nin the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf\\nwho now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his\\near hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus’s locket bouncing on\\nhis thin chest.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n197\\n“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinn-\\ner,” croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to\\nhang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that\\nhad been freshly laundered.\\n“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had\\nbeen poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that litter-\\ned the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode\\ntoward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parch-\\nment.\\nA large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at\\nthem all, beneath a headline that read:\\nSEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS\\nHEADMASTER\\n“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.\\nHermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read\\nthe accompanying story out loud.\\n“’Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts\\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed\\nheadmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at\\nthe ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous\\nMuggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post\\nwhile her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against\\nthe Dark Arts professor.’”\\n“’I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding\\ntraditions and values –’ Like committing murder and cutting off\\npeople’s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in\\nDumbledore’s study – Merlin’s pants!”\\n– she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the\\ntable and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n198\\nminute!”\\n“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must be upset.”\\nHe pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.\\n“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and\\nSprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t\\naccept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?”\\n“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were\\nat the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends\\ntogether. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, “I can’t see that\\nthe other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and\\nVoldemort are behind Snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching,\\nor a nice few years in Azkaban – and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll\\nstay to try and protect the students.”\\nKreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and\\nladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.\\n“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to\\nhave to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know exactly where Snape\\nis now.”\\nHe began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher’s cook-\\ning had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus’s\\nlocket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.\\n“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he told Ron\\nas he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying\\nour school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.”\\nRon glanced at his watch.\\n“I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird,\\nnot being on it, isn’t it?”\\nIn his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and\\nRon had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a\\nrippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were\\nsitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Her-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n199\\nmione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape’s new regime.\\n“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I landed\\nbadly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.”\\n“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his\\nseat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. “And what in the name of\\nMerlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?”\\n“I remembered this,” Hermione panted.\\nShe was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the\\nfloor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard.\\nOpening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact\\nthat it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds\\nit had vanished, like so much else, into the bag’s capacious depths.\\n“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the\\nkitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.\\n“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas\\nNigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and\\nthe one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular\\ntowertop room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant\\npossession of Dumbledore’s collection of delicate, silver magical instru-\\nments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved\\nelsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.\\n“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,”\\nHermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. “But let him try it now,\\nall Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.”\\n“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed.\\n“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. “So, Harry,\\nwhat else happened today?”\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours.\\nNo sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.”\\nRon nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far\\ntoo dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n200\\nin and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Mini-\\nstry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him,\\neven if he did look very strained and anxious.\\n“Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to\\nwork,” Ron said. “That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk,\\nshe’d think she’s too important.”\\n“And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy\\nrobes?” Hermione asked.\\n“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron.\\n“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermione ask-\\ned, her soupspoon suspended in midair.\\n“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.”\\n“But you never told us that!”\\nHermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes\\nand maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the\\nkitchen.\\n“There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!” she said, flipp-\\ning feverishly through the pages.\\n“Well, does it really matter?”\\n“Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and not give\\nourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every\\nlittle detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point\\nof all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us –”\\n“Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing –”\\n“You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous\\nplace in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of –”\\n“I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry.\\nHermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his\\nsoup.\\n“Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, Harry?”\\n“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n201\\nthan we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another\\nmonth. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be.\\nThere’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing\\ndoesn’t open.”\\n“Unless,” said Ron, “she’s found a way of opening it and she’s now poss-\\nessed.”\\n“Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,”\\nHarry shrugged.\\nHermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.\\n“We know everything important,” Harry went on, addressing Hermione.\\n“We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know\\nonly the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes\\nto the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables\\ncomplaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge’s office is,\\nbecause of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate –”\\n“‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,’” Hermione recited\\nimmediately.\\n“Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using those funny coins,\\nor tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one\\nfrom her friend –”\\n“But we haven’t got any!”\\n“If the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly.\\n“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know... There are an awful lot of things that\\ncould go wrong, so much relies on chance “\\n“That’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,” said\\nHarry. “It’s time to act.”\\nHe could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that they were scared; he\\nwas not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had\\ncome to put their plan into operation.\\nThey had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invi-\\nsibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n202\\nthanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Mini-\\nstry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and\\nlearned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to\\nappear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a\\nchance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they\\nhad built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.\\n“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow I think it\\nshould just be me and Harry.”\\n“Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I thought we’d settled\\nthis.”\\n“It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is\\ndifferent, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet\\ndated ten days previously. “You’re on the list of Muggle-borns who didn’t\\npresent themselves for interrogation!”\\n“And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If\\nanyone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on\\nhis head –”\\n“Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever defeat Volde-\\nmort, won’t you?”\\nAs Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry’s\\nforehead. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes narrow, and he\\ntried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.\\n“Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately,” Ron\\nwas saying. “We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore.”\\nHarry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once,\\nKreacher hurried forward.\\n“Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew,\\nor else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?”\\n“Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute – er – bathroom.”\\nAware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up\\nthe stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n203\\nbathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over\\nthe black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and clos-\\ned his eyes...\\nHe was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him\\nhad high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses.\\nHe approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-\\nfingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excite-\\nment...\\nThe door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she\\nlooked into Harry’s face: humor gone, terror replacing it...\\n“Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice.\\nShe shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held\\nit steady, prevented her shutting him out...\\n“I want Gregorovitch.”\\n“Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!” she cried, shaking her head. “He no live here!\\nHe no live here! I know him not!”\\nAbandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down\\nthe dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered\\nhand had drawn his wand.\\n“Where is he?”\\n“Das weiß ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!”\\nHe raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came running\\ninto the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of\\ngreen light –\\n“Harry! HARRY!”\\nHe opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on\\nthe door again.\\n“Harry, open up!”\\nHe had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Her-\\nmione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around\\nsuspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n204\\nwand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.\\n“What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly.\\n“What d’you think I was doing?” asked Harry with feeble bravado. “You\\nwere yelling your head off!” said Ron.\\n“Oh yeah I must’ve dozed off or –”\\n“Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said Hermione, taking deep\\nbreaths. “We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you’re white as a sheet.”\\nHarry sat down on the edge of the bath.\\n“Fine. I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he’s\\nprobably killed her whole family. And he didn’t need to. It was Cedric all\\nover again, they were just there “\\n“Harry, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!” Hermione\\ncried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. “Dumbledore wanted you\\nto use Occlumency! He thought the connection was dangerous – Voldemort\\ncan use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it\\nhelp?”\\n“Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry. “So you’re not\\neven going to try to shut him out?”\\n“Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the\\nhang of it.”\\n“You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, Harry – do you\\nlike having this special connection or relationship or what – whatever –”\\nShe faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.\\n“Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?”\\n“I – no – I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean –”\\n“I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch\\nhim when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.”\\n“Dumbledore –”\\n“Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. I want to know\\nwhy he’s after Gregorovitch.”\\n“Who?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n205\\n“He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made Krum’s wand and\\nKrum reckons he’s brilliant.”\\n“But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got Ollivander locked\\nup somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another\\none for?”\\n“Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better...\\nor else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did\\nwhen he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t know.”\\nHarry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione\\nexchanging skeptical looks behind his back.\\n“Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said Hermione, “but\\nyou made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility\\nfor your own power?”\\n“Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We\\nboth know what really happened!”\\nThey glared at each other: Harry knew that he had not convinced Her-\\nmione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his\\ntheory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into\\nVoldemort’s mind. To his relief, Ron intervened.\\n“Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re going to the Mini-\\nstry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the plan?”\\nReluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest,\\nthough Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity.\\nIn the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher\\nserved them all stew and treacle tart.\\nThey did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going\\nover and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other.\\nHarry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay in bed with his wandlight\\ntrained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew,\\nand muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished\\nhis wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pasti-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n206\\nlles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Grego-\\nrovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while\\nVoldemort sought him so determinedly.\\nDawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.\\n“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake\\nHarry.\\n“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning.\\nThey found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served\\ncoffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression\\nthat Harry associated with exam review.\\n“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a\\nnervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice\\nPotion... Invisibility Cloak... Decoy Detonators... You should each take a\\ncouple just in case... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable\\nEars...”\\nThey gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing\\nthem out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when\\nthey returned.\\n“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to fantasize\\nabout cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.”\\nThey made their way onto the front step with immense caution: They\\ncould see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from\\nacross the misty square.\\nHermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry.\\nAfter the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found\\nhimself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was sche-\\nduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins;\\nthe first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight\\no’clock.\\n“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought to be here\\nin about five minutes. When I’ve Stunned her –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n207\\n“Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I thought we were suppo-\\nsed to open the door before she got here?”\\nHermione squealed.\\n“I nearly forgot! Stand back –”\\nShe pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door\\nbeside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led,\\nas they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Her-\\nmione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as though it was still\\nclosed.\\n“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway,\\n“we put on the Cloak again –”\\n“– and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione’s head like a\\nblanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.\\nLittle more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry\\nwitch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in\\nthe sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She\\nbarely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Her-\\nmione’s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.\\n“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside\\nthe theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they\\ncarried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Her-\\nmione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head and added them to a flask\\nof muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was\\nrummaging through the little witch’s handbag.\\n“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that identified\\ntheir victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. “You’d\\nbetter take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.”\\nHe passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters\\nM.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse.\\nHermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant helio-\\ntrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n208\\nHopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry\\nchecked his watch.\\n“We’re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.”\\nThey hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw\\nthe Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view,\\nwaiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety-looking\\nwizard appeared before them.\\n“Oh, hello, Mafalda.”\\n“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are you today?”\\n“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly\\ndowncast.\\nAs Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron\\ncrept along behind them.\\n“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the weather,” said Hermione, talking\\nfirmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems; it\\nwas essential to stop him from reaching the street. “Here, have a sweet.”\\n“Eh? Oh, no thanks –”\\n“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his\\nface. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.\\nThe effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his\\ntongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice\\nas Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head.\\n“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps you’d\\nbetter take the day off!”\\n“No – no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite\\nbeing unable to walk straight. “I must – today – must go –”\\n“But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You can’t go to work in\\nthis state – I think you ought to go to St. Mungo’s and get them to sort you\\nout!”\\nThe wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl\\ntoward the main street.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n209\\n“You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried Hermione.\\nAt last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed\\nHermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the\\nspot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched\\nfrom his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit.\\n“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the\\npuddles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.”\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard’s\\nbag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn\\nmore attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t he? Chuck us the hair and the\\npotion, then.”\\nWithin two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the\\nsick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his\\nbag.\\n“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much he\\nwanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the\\nback.”\\n“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invi-\\nsibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.”\\nHe had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking\\nalone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned\\nMafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.\\n“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several curly\\nblack hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he’s pre-\\ntty tall, you’ll need bigger robes…”\\nShe pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them,\\nand Harry retired to take the potion and change.\\nOnce the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet\\ntall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully\\nbuilt. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses\\ninside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n210\\n“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered\\nover him.\\n“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s go, it’s\\nnearly nine.”\\nThey stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded\\npavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps, one\\nlabeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES.\\n“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and she tottered\\noff down the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly\\ndressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground\\npublic toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.\\n“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let\\nhimself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door.\\n“Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way!\\nWho are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?”\\nThe wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced\\nchuckle. “Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?”\\nAnd he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.\\nTo Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down\\nand peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see\\na pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and\\nsaw Ron blinking at him.\\n“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered.\\n“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gra-\\nvelly.\\nThey both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into\\nthe toilet.\\nHe knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to\\nbe standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reach-\\ned up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute,\\nemerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n211\\nHe got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accus-\\ntomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Pre-\\nviously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimm-\\nering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a\\ngigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening,\\nthis vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones,\\nlooking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them.\\nEngraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words\\nMAGIC IS MIGHT.\\nHarry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had\\njust flown out of the fireplace behind him.\\n“Out of the way, can’t y – oh, sorry, Runcorn!”\\nClearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man\\nwhom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.\\n“Psst!” said a voice, and he looked around to see a wispy little witch and\\nthe ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over\\nbeside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.\\n“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry. “No, he’s still\\nstuck in the bog,” said Ron.\\n“Oh, very funny... It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry, who was star-\\ning up at the statue. “Have you seen what they’re sitting on?”\\nHarry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were\\ndecoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hund-\\nreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with\\nrather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight\\nof the handsomely robed wizards.\\n“Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful place. Come on, let’s\\nget going.”\\nThey joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden\\ngates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible,\\nbut there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n212\\npassed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming\\nin front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely\\njoined the nearest one when a voice said, “Cattermole!”\\nThey looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the Death\\nEaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding toward them.\\nThe Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry\\ncould feel fear rippling through them. The man’s scowling, slightly brutish\\nface was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which\\nwere embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the\\nlifts called sycophantically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them.\\n“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office,\\nCattermole. It’s still raining in there.”\\nRon looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but\\nnobody spoke.\\n“Raining... in your office? That’s – that’s not good, is it?” Ron gave a\\nnervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened.\\n“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?”\\nA pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off.\\n“No,” said Ron, “no, of course –”\\n“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife,\\nCattermole? In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her\\nhand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably\\nwise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”\\nHermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She\\ncoughed feebly and turned away.\\n“I – I –” stammered Ron.\\n“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “– not\\nthat any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth – and the\\nHead of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing,\\nI would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand\\nme?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n213\\n“Yes,” whispered Ron.\\n“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry\\nwithin an hour, your wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than\\nit is now.”\\nThe golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant\\nsmile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of\\nCattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Her-\\nmione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were\\ninfectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward.\\n“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once; he looked\\nstricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife – I mean, Cattermole’s wife –”\\n“We’ll come with you, we should stick together –” began Harry, but Ron\\nshook his head feverishly.\\n“That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I’ll\\ngo and sort out Yaxley’s office – but how do I stop it raining?”\\n“Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that should stop the rain\\nif it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s gone wrong with an Atmo-\\nspheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure\\ntry Impervius to protect his belongings –”\\n“Say it again, slowly –” said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for\\na quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female\\nvoice said, “Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magi-\\ncal Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin\\nLiaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again,\\nadmitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that\\nfluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.\\n“Morning, Albert,” said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He\\nglanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more;\\nHermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard lea-\\nned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin\\nLiaison? Nice one, Albert. I’m pretty confident I’ll get his job now!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n214\\nHe winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift\\nstopped; the grilles opened once more.\\n“Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the\\nImproper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot\\nAdministration Services,” said the disembodied witch’s voice.\\nHarry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift,\\nfollowed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The\\nmoment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, “Actually,\\nHarry, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think he knows what he’s doing\\nand if he gets caught the whole thing –”\\n“Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.”\\nThe golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people\\nstood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-haired wizard\\nwearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch\\nwearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n215\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION\\n“A\\nh, Mafalda!” said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. “Travers sent\\nyou, did he?”\\n“Y-yes,” squeaked Hermione.\\n“Good, you’ll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black\\nand gold. “That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared\\nfor record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.” She consulted\\nher clipboard. “Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry\\nemployee! Tut, tut... even here, in the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped\\ninto the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening\\nto Umbridge’s conversation with the Minister. “We’ll go straight down,\\nMafalda, you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning,\\nAlbert, aren’t you getting out?”\\n“Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice.\\nHarry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him.\\nGlancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione’s anxious face sinking\\nback out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge’s velvet hair-\\nbow level with her shoulder.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n216\\n“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister of Magic.\\nHis long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great\\noverhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of\\na crab looking out from beneath a rock.\\n“Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second,\\n“Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.”\\n“Ah,” said Pius Thicknesse. “Has he been caught having contact with an\\nUndesirable?”\\n“No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like that.”\\n“Ah, well. It’s only a matter of time,” said Thicknesse. “If you ask me,\\nthe blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.”\\n“Good day, Minister.”\\nHarry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted\\ncorridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged\\nthe Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over\\nhimself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn\\nwas so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were\\nhidden.\\nPanic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden\\ndoor after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the\\nowner’s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its\\ncomplexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that the\\nplan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past\\nfour weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all their\\nefforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a\\nmoment’s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate.\\nNow Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly\\nlast hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond\\nhim, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, Harry,\\nwas wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his\\nquarry had just gone down in the lift.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n217\\nHe stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do.\\nThe silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift\\nfootsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the\\nMuffliato charm had been cast over the place.\\nHer office must be up here, Harry thought.\\nIt seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her\\noffice, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure.\\nHe therefore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning\\nwizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of\\nhim, scribbling on a trail of parchment.\\nNow paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner.\\nHalfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where\\na dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school\\ndesks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry\\npaused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all\\nwaving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper\\nwere flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds,\\nHarry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers\\nall formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds he realized that\\nwhat he was watching was the creation of pamphlets – that the paper squares\\nwere pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell\\ninto neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.\\nHarry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were\\ndoing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he\\nslid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined\\nit beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a\\ngolden title:\\nMUDBLOODS\\nand the Dangers They Pose to\\na Peaceful Pure-Blood Society\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n218\\nBeneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the\\nmiddle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl.\\nThere was no author’s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the\\nback of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. Then the young\\nwitch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and\\ntwirling her wand, “Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day,\\ndoes anyone know?”\\n“Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of\\nhis pages slipped and fell to the floor.\\n“What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?”\\nThe witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space\\nfull of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a\\nsnake. Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a\\nlarge, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood – an eye\\nthat was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody.\\nFor a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing\\nthere: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the\\ndoor to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly upward, frozen.\\nThe plaque beneath it read:\\nDOLORES UMBRIDGE\\nSENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER\\nBelow that, a slightly shinier new plaque read:\\nHEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN\\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\\nHarry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were\\nintent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice\\nif the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore with-\\ndrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n219\\nrubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he plac-\\ned the Decoy Detonator on the ground.\\nIt scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in\\nfront of him. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand\\nupon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black\\nsmoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row shrieked:\\nPink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking\\naround for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped\\ninto Umbridge’s office, and closed the door behind him.\\nHe felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbri-\\ndge’s office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried flowers covered\\nevery available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each\\nfeaturing a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with\\nsickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth.\\nBehind Mad-Eye’s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy\\non the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it\\nand saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He\\nwrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the\\nmagical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned to face\\nthe room again, raised his wand, and murmured, “Accio Locket.”\\nNothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge\\nknew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind\\nher desk and began pulling open the drawers. He saw quills and notebooks\\nand Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their\\ndrawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair\\nbows and clips; but no sign of a locket.\\nThere was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like\\nFilch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with\\na name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw\\nsomething to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s file.\\nHe pulled it out and opened it.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n220\\nARTHUR WEASLEY\\n___________________________________________\\nBLOOD: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings.\\nSTATUS: Known member of the Order of the Phoenix.\\nFAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hog-\\nwarts.\\nNB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry\\ninspectors have confirmed.\\nTRACKED: All movements are being monitored.\\nSECURITY: Strong likelihood Undesirable.\\nSTATUS: No. 1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family prev-\\niously)\\n“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he\\nreplaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew\\nwho that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around\\nthe office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall,\\nwith the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A\\nlittle pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry\\nmoved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be\\npunished.”\\nAngrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and\\nbaskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not\\nthere. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a\\nbeat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, pro-\\npped up on a bookcase beside the desk.\\nHarry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized the\\nmoment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n221\\nwistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not imme-\\ndiately noticed the curly green writing across his hat – The Life and Lies of\\nAlbus Dumbledore – nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by\\nRita Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?”\\nHarry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two\\nteenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each\\nother’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a\\ntiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed\\nRon. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a\\ngleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders.\\nHarry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check\\nthe caption, the door of the office opened.\\nIf Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry\\nwould not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it\\nwas, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement,\\nbecause for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring curiously at the\\nplace where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen\\nwas Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had\\nhastily replaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and\\npointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and\\nbegan scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe,\\nHarry backed out of the office into the open area beyond.\\nThe pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the\\nDecoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry\\nhurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here\\nfrom Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous\\nduck?”\\nSpeeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never\\nbeen likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope\\nof bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a\\ncrowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n222\\nthey were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to\\nfind Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from\\nthe courtroom.\\nThe lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the\\nInvisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it\\nrattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in.\\n“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.\\n“Ron, it’s me, Harry!”\\n“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like – why isn’t Hermione with\\nyou?”\\n“She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn’t\\nrefuse, and –”\\nBut before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again: The doors\\nopened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose\\nblonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill.\\n“...I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m afraid I\\ncannot be party to –”\\nMr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have\\nMr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and\\nthe four of them trundled downward once more.\\n“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of\\nsteady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for questioning today?\\nEr – what’s happened to you? Why are you so wet?”\\n“Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley’s\\nshoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize\\nhim if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t stop it, so\\nthey’ve sent me to get Bernie – Pillsworth, I think they said –”\\n“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley. “Did\\nyou try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.”\\n“Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks, D – I\\nmean, thanks, Arthur.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n223\\nThe lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron\\ndarted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path\\nblocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers\\nhe was reading.\\nNot until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a\\nlift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and\\nleft the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry\\ntried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.\\n“One moment, Runcorn.”\\nThe lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weas-\\nley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.”\\nHarry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less because\\nof the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid.\\n“Sorry?” he said.\\n“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. “You tracked\\ndown the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?”\\n“I – so what if I did?” said Harry.\\n“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr. Weasley\\nquietly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives Azkaban, you’ll have\\nto answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends –”\\n“Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being tracked, don’t\\nyou?”\\n“Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly.\\n“No,” said Harry, “it’s a fact! They’re watching your every move –”\\nThe lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave\\nHarry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He\\nwished he was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn... The lift doors\\nclanged shut.\\nHarry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try\\nto extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining\\noffice. When the doors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit stone\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n224\\npassageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors\\nabove. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking\\ntoward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of\\nMysteries.\\nHe set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remem-\\nbered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to\\nthe court chambers. His mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down\\nthem: He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be\\nbetter to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for\\na quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn\\nwas sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it,\\nHermione’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear\\nof the Ministry...\\nLost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that\\nwas creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming\\ncolder and colder with every step he took: a cold that reached right down\\ninto his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of\\ndespair, of hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him...\\nDementors, he thought.\\nAnd as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a\\ndreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with\\ntall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged\\nbreathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought\\nin for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most\\nof them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive\\nattempt to shield themselves from the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some\\nwere accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were glid-\\ning up and down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and\\nthe despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse...\\nFight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus\\nhere without revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n225\\nas he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his\\nbrain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed\\nhim.\\nMoving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless\\nfaces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that\\nthey sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some\\nhope, some resilience...\\nAnd then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the\\ndungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams\\nechoed out of it.\\n“No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a\\nwizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a well-known broomstick\\ndesigner, look him up, I tell you – get your hands off me, get your hands\\noff–”\\n“This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magically mag-\\nnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams. “If you\\nstruggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.”\\nThe man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor.\\n“Take him away,” said Umbridge.\\nTwo dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting,\\nscabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be\\nfainting. They glided away down the corridor with him, and the darkness\\nthey trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.\\n“Next – Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge.\\nA small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark\\nhair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long, plain robes. Her face\\nwas completely bloodless. As she passed the dementors, Harry saw her\\nshudder.\\nHe did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight\\nof her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed,\\nhe slipped into the courtroom behind her.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n226\\nIt was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for\\nimproper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was\\nquite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom\\nof a deep well.\\nThere were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the\\nplace; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high,\\nraised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on\\none side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on\\nthe other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowl-\\ned up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect\\nthe prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That\\nwas for the accused to feel, not the accusers.\\n“Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice.\\nMrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor\\nbeneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked\\nout of the arms of the chair and bound her there.\\n“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge. Mrs. Catter-\\nmole gave a single, shaky nod.\\n“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Depart-\\nment?”\\nMrs. Cattermole burst into tears.\\n“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!” Umbridge\\nignored her.\\n“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?” Mrs. Cattermole sob-\\ned harder than ever.\\n“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home –”\\n“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sym-\\npathies.”\\nMrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made his way\\ncarefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he\\nhad passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n227\\ntemperature: It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure,\\nwas Umbridge’s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in\\nher element, upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly and\\nvery carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge,\\nYaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about\\nmaking Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon\\nUmbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Her-\\nmione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole,\\nand Harry seized his chance.\\n“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear.\\nAs he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the\\nbottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview,\\nbut both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole,\\nand this went unnoticed.\\n“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today,\\nMrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying. “Eight-and-three-quarter inches,\\ncherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?”\\nMrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.\\n“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that\\nwand?”\\n“T-took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from anybody. I\\nbbought it when I was eleven years old. It – it – it – chose me.”\\nShe cried harder than ever.\\nUmbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her.\\nShe leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and\\nsomething gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket.\\nHermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yax-\\nley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else.\\n“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only\\nchoose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to\\nthe questionnaire that was sent to you here – Mafalda, pass them to me.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n228\\nUmbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment\\nthat Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers.\\nHermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of\\ndocuments balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of\\nparchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s name on it.\\n“That’s – that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleam-\\ning in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.\\n“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes – an old family\\nheirloom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. “The S\\nstands for Selwyn... I am related to the Selwyns... Indeed, there are few\\npure-blood families to whom I am not related... A pity,” she continued in a\\nlouder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the\\nsame cannot be said for you. ‘Parents’ professions: greengrocers.’”\\nYaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and\\ndown, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.\\nIt was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s brain\\nand obliterated his sense of caution – that the locket she had taken as a bribe\\nfrom a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood\\ncredentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed\\nbeneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, “Stupefy!”\\nThere was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit\\nthe edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers slid off her lap onto\\nthe floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit\\nthem like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the\\nsource of the trouble and saw Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing\\nat him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: “Stupefy!”\\nYaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. “Harry!”\\n“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend –”\\n“Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!”\\nHarry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below,\\nthe dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n229\\nwoman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or\\nbecause they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they\\nseemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible\\nscream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her\\nface back.\\n“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”\\nThe silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand and leaped toward\\nthe dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The\\nstag’s light, more powerful and more warming than the cat’s protection,\\nfilled the whole dungeon as it cantered around and around the room.\\n“Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione.\\nHe ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back into his\\nbag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole.\\n“You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But – but Reg said you were\\nthe one who submitted my name for questioning!”\\n“Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms. “Well,\\nI’ve had a change of heart. Diffindo!” Nothing happened. “Hermione, how\\ndo I get rid of these chains?”\\n“Wait, I’m trying something up here –”\\n“Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!”\\n“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone – I need to\\nduplicate it – Geminio! There... That should fool her “\\nHermione came running downstairs. “Let’s see Relashio!”\\nThe chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Catter-\\nmole looked just as frightened as ever before. “I don’t understand,” she\\nwhispered.\\n“You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, pulling her to her feet.\\n“Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you’ve\\ngot to. Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen how it is, you won’t get\\nanything like a fair hearing here.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n230\\n“Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out of here with all\\nthose dementors outside the door?”\\n“Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag slowed\\nand walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. “As many as we can\\nmuster; do yours, Hermione.”\\n“Expec – Expecto patronum,” said Hermione. Nothing happened.\\n“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told a completely\\nbemused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate, really... Come on, Hermi-\\none…”\\n“Expecto patronum!”\\nA silver otter burst from the end of Hermione’s wand and swam grace-\\nfully through the air to join the stag.\\n“C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the\\ndoor.\\nWhen the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock\\nfrom the people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were\\nfalling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering\\nbefore the silver creatures.\\n“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with\\nyour families,” Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were dazzled by\\nthe light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly. “Go abroad if you\\ncan. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s the – er – new official\\nposition. Now, if you’ll just follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave\\nfrom the Atrium.”\\nThey managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as\\nthey approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged\\ninto the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty\\nor so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling\\nthat they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this\\nunwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n231\\n“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron’s arms.\\n“Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of\\nus to leave the country, I think we’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry\\nhome and fetch the children and – why are you so wet?”\\n“Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, they know there\\nare intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge’s\\noffice door, I reckon we’ve got five minutes if that –”\\nHermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror-struck\\nface to Harry.\\n“Harry, if we’re trapped here –!”\\n“We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He addressed the silent group\\nbehind them, who were all gawping at him.\\n“Who’s got wands?”\\nAbout half of them raised their hands.\\n“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to\\nsomebody who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.”\\nThey managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry’s Patronus stood\\nsentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise.\\n“Level eight,” said the witch’s cool voice, “Atrium.”\\nHarry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of\\npeople moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off.\\n“Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going to –?”\\n“STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed\\nthrough the Atrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. “Follow me,”\\nhe whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward\\nin a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione.\\n“What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard who had followed\\nHarry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous.\\n“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry with all the\\nauthority he could muster.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n232\\nThe group of wizards in front of him looked at one another. “We’ve been\\ntold to seal all exits and not let anyone –”\\n“Are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would you like me to\\nhave your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?”\\n“Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I didn’t mean\\nnothing, Albert, but I thought... I thought they were in for questioning\\nand...”\\n“Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively\\nthrough the hall. “Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,” he\\nboomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and\\nbegan to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking\\nconfused, others scared and resentful. Then:\\n“Mary!”\\nMrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no\\nlonger vomiting but pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift.\\n“R-Reg?”\\nShe looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.\\nThe balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg\\nCattermole to the other.\\n“Hey – what’s going on? What is this?”\\n“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!”\\nYaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group\\nbeside the fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Catter-\\nmole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised\\nan enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the air.\\n“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” Harry shouted.\\nThe balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which\\nRon grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and\\ndisappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard,\\nwhile the real Reg Cattermole screamed, “My wife! Who was that with my\\nwife? What’s going on?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n233\\nHarry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of the truth dawn in that\\nbrutish face.\\n“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they\\njumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s\\nhead. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a\\ncubicle. Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing there beside the sinks,\\nstill wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.\\n“Reg, I don’t understand –”\\n“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!”\\nThere was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around;\\nYaxley had just appeared.\\n“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by\\nthe arm and turned on the spot.\\nDarkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing bands,\\nbut something was wrong... Hermione’s hand seemed to be sliding out of\\nhis grip...\\nHe wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or\\nsee and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm and Hermione’s\\nfingers, which were slowly slipping away...\\nAnd then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its\\nserpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream\\nand a flash of purple light; Hermione’s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his\\nand everything went dark again.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n234\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\\nTHE THIEF\\nH\\narry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no\\nidea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to\\nbe leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened,\\nhe blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through\\na canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face.\\nHe pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small,\\nfierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron’s foot. Looking around,\\nHarry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently\\nalone.\\nHarry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even\\nthough he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear\\nin the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking throu-\\ngh the trees to Hagrid’s hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron\\nto give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that\\nthis was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were\\nmore widely spaced, the ground clearer.\\nHe met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron’s head. The mom-\\nent his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry’s mind, for blood\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n235\\ndrenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, grayishwhite,\\nagainst the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now:\\nRon was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair\\nturning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.\\n“What’s happened to him?”\\n“Splinched,” said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron’s sleeve,\\nwhere the blood was wettest and darkest.\\nHarry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron’s shirt. He had always\\nthought of Splinching as something comical, but this... His insides crawled\\nunpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s upper arm, where a great chunk\\nof flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.\\n“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of\\nDittany’ –”\\n“Bag – right –”\\nHarry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny\\nbeaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began\\npresenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly\\nsleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes –\\n“Quickly!”\\nHe grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of\\nthe magical bag.\\n“Accio Dittany!”\\nA small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened\\nback to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of\\nwhite eyeball all that were visible between his lids.\\n“He’s fainted,” said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer\\nlooked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. “Unstopper it\\nfor me, Harry, my hands are shaking.”\\nHarry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and\\npoured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke\\nbillowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n236\\nstopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over\\nwhat had just been open flesh.\\n“Wow,” said Harry.\\n“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells that\\nwould put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong\\nand cause more damage... He’s lost so much blood already “\\n“How did he get hurt? I mean” – Harry shook his head, trying to clear it,\\nto make sense of whatever had just taken place – “why are we here? I\\nthought we were going back to Grimmauld Place?”\\nHermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears. “Harry, I don’t\\nthink we’re going to be able to go back there.”\\n“What d’you –?”\\n“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t get rid of\\nhim, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at\\nGrimmauld Place, and then – well, I think he must have seen the door, and\\nthought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to\\nshake him off and I brought us here instead!”\\n“But then, where’s he? Hang on... You don’t mean he’s at Grimmauld\\nPlace? He can’t get in there?”\\nHer eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.\\n“Harry, I think he can. I – I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx,\\nbut I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s protection. Since\\nDumbledore died, we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve given him the secret, hav-\\nen’t I?”\\nThere was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious\\nblow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they\\ncould return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by\\nApparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their\\none safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and\\nfriendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n237\\nwith food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-\\nand-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.\\n“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”\\n“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was mine “\\nHarry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye. Hermione\\nrecoiled, looking horrified.\\n“Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn’t\\nleave it there but that’s how they knew there were intruders.”\\nBefore Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He\\nwas still gray and his face glistened with sweat.\\n“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered.\\n“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. “Where are\\nwe?”\\n“In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said Her-\\nmione. “I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was –”\\n“– the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for her, glancing around\\nat the apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had\\nhappened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had\\nthought of – how Death Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been\\nLegilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where\\nHermione had taken them?\\n“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, and Harry could\\ntell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking the same.\\n“I dunno.”\\nRon still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and\\nit looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him\\nwas daunting.\\n“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said.\\nLooking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. “Where are you going?”\\nasked Ron.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n238\\n“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around\\nthe place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide\\ncircle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry\\nsaw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast\\na heat haze upon their clearing.\\n“Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum... Repello Muggletum... Muffliato.\\n.. You could get out the tent, Harry “\\n“Tent?”\\n“In the bag!”\\n“In the of course,” said Harry.\\nHe did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summon-\\ning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles.\\nHarry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in\\nwhich they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup.\\n“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?” he asked,\\nstarting to disentangle the tent pegs.\\n“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said Her-\\nmione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her\\nwand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she added, pointing\\nher wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid motion rose into the\\nair and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose\\nstartled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy\\nrope.\\n“Cave Inimicum,” Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. “That’s as\\nmuch as I can do. At the very least, we should know they’re coming, I can’t\\nguarantee it will keep out Vol –”\\n“Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. Harry and\\nHermione looked at each other.\\n“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at\\nthem, “but it feels like a – a jinx or something. Can’t we call him You-\\nKnow-Who – please?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n239\\n“Dumbledore said fear of a name –” began Harry.\\n“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name\\ndidn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron snapped back. “Just –\\njust show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?”\\n“Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; appa-\\nrently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened\\ncondition.\\nHarry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance\\nof the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it: a small flat,\\ncomplete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair\\nand lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this\\nvery short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled\\nhim on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.\\n“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs\\nfrom the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.\\nHarry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the\\nnight that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear flutt-\\nering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence.\\n“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?”\\n“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching her hot\\nmug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he’ll\\nhave transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they’ll be\\nfleeing the country right now with their children. That’s what Harry told her\\nto do.”\\n“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his pillows.\\nThe tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. “I\\ndidn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the\\nway everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it\\nIf they both end up in Azkaban because of us…”\\nHarry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask\\n– about whether Mrs. Cattermole’s lack of a wand would prevent her Appa-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n240\\nrating alongside her husband – died in his throat. Hermione was watching\\nRon fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in\\nher expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of\\nkissing him.\\n“So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was\\nthere.\\n“Got – got what?” she said with a little start.\\n“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s the lo-\\ncket?”\\n“You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows.\\n“No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!”\\n“Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren’t we?”\\nsaid Hermione. “Here.”\\nAnd she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to\\nRon.\\nIt was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many\\nsmall green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the\\ntent’s canvas roof.\\n“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?”\\nasked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are we sure it’s still a Horcrux?”\\n“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it\\nclosely. “There’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically des-\\ntroyed.”\\nShe passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked\\nperfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how\\nthe stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore\\ndestroyed it.\\n“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to have to work\\nout how to open this thing before we can destroy it.”\\nSudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little\\ngolden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n241\\nfelt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he\\ntried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then attempted the charm\\nHermione had used to open Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He\\nhanded the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best,\\nbut were no more successful at opening it than he had been.\\n“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight\\nin his clenched fist.\\n“What d’you mean?”\\nRon passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought\\nhe knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins\\nthat he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny\\nmetal heart?\\n“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked.\\n“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” Harry replied, and, little\\nthough he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the\\nlocket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside\\nthe pouch Hagrid had given him.\\n“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,” he\\nadded to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And we’ll need to think\\nabout some food as well. You stay there,” he added sharply, as Ron attempt-\\nted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.\\nWith the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set\\ncarefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of\\nthe day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained\\nsilent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective\\nenchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around\\nthem, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood re-\\nmained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought\\nno change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten\\no’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n242\\nhigh above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their\\nprotected clearing.\\nHe felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed\\nany food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be return-\\ning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except\\nsome wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the\\nnearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had\\npushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as\\nnot to hurt Hermione’s feelings.\\nThe surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded\\nlike crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals\\nrather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides,\\nalready uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mush-\\nrooms, tingled with unease.\\nHe had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back\\nthe Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the\\ndarkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what\\nwould happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point\\nfor weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt\\nhalt, run out of road.\\nThere were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the\\nfaintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them\\nwere. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that\\nthey had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his\\nchest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against\\nhis skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry\\nthought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking\\nirregularly alongside his own.\\nNameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark: He tried\\nto resist them, push them away, yet they came at him relentlessly. Neither\\ncan live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking softly\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n243\\nbehind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not.\\nAnd it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and\\nexhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he\\nhad left... Stupid idea, he told himself, don’t think that...\\nHis scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making\\nit happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another\\nchannel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and\\nhad received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the\\nDeath Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had\\nchanged toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who\\nknew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick\\nimages swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away too, for\\nthere was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already\\ndecided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry\\ncame too? They could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the\\nsame flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Her-\\nmione’s sleeve.\\nHarry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they\\ndid not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered\\nor imagined. Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that\\nthere would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries perhaps, like\\nhis friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong... Snape had seen to\\nthat... Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower...\\nAnd Dumbledore had fallen... fallen...\\n“Give it to me, Gregorovitch.”\\nHarry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by\\na long-fingered white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was sus-\\npended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he\\nswung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his\\nterrified face, on a level with Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed\\nto his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n244\\nFather Christmas.\\n“I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!”\\n“Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows... He always\\nknows.”\\nThe hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed\\nto swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole –\\nAnd now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregor-\\novitch’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room\\nat the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a\\nworkshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light,\\nand there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man\\nwith golden hair. In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him,\\nHarry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stu-\\nnning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window\\nwith a crow of laughter.\\nAnd Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and\\nGregorovitch’s face was stricken with terror.\\n“Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice.\\n“I do not know, I never knew, a young man – no – please – PLEASE!” A\\nscream that went on and on and then a burst of green light – “Harry!”\\nHe opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out\\nagainst the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was\\nsprawled on the ground. He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy hair\\nobscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above\\nthem.\\n“Dream,” he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione’s\\nglower with a look of innocence. “Must’ve dozed off, sorry.”\\n“I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were\\nlooking into Vol –”\\n“Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths of the\\ntent.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n245\\n“Fine,” retorted Hermione. “You-Know-Who’s mind, then!”\\n“I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a dream! Can you control\\nwhat you dream about, Hermione?”\\n“If you just learned to apply Occlumency –”\\nBut Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what\\nhe had just seen.\\n“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed him, but\\nbefore he killed him he read Gregorovitch’s mind and I saw –”\\n“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling\\nasleep,” said Hermione coldly.\\n“I can finish the watch!”\\n“No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.”\\nShe dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but\\nwishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.\\nRon’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed\\ninto the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling.\\nAfter several moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry\\nto Hermione, huddled in the entrance.\\n“What’s You-Know-Who doing?”\\nHarry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then\\nwhispered into the darkness.\\n“He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.”\\n“How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s tied up?”\\n“I dunno It’s weird, isn’t it?”\\nHarry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard. The more he\\nrecalled, the less sense it made Voldemort had said nothing about Harry’s\\nwand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a\\nnew and more powerful wand to beat Harry’s...\\n“He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, eyes still closed\\ntight. “He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen\\nfrom him... and then... then…”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n246\\nHe remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through\\nGregorovitch’s eyes, into his memories...\\n“He read Gregorovitch’s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a\\nwindowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight.\\nHe stole it, he stole whatever You-Know-Who’s after. And I I think I’ve\\nseen him somewhere…”\\nHarry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy’s face.\\nThe theft had happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why\\ndid the young thief look familiar?\\nThe noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all\\nHarry could hear was Ron’s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered,\\n“Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?”\\n“No it must’ve been something small.”\\n“Harry?”\\nThe wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in\\nbed. “Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after something else to\\nturn into a Horcrux?”\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly. “Maybe. But wouldn’t it be dangerous\\nfor him to make another one? Didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul\\nto the limit already?”\\n“Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.”\\n“Yeah maybe,” said Harry.\\nHe had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the\\nproblem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the\\nold wandmaker... and yet he had killed him, apparently without asking him\\na single question about wandlore.\\nWhat was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic\\nand the Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit\\nof an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen\\nby the unknown thief?\\nHarry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face; it was merry, wild;\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n247\\nthere was a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He\\nhad soared from the windowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before,\\nbut he could not think where...\\nWith Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger\\nnow, and it was on him that Harry’s thoughts dwelled, as Ron’s snores\\nbegan to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into\\nsleep once more.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n248\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\\nTHE GOBLIN’S REVENGE\\nE\\narly next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the\\ntent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and\\nresilientlooking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye\\nMoody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with\\nhis wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much\\npreferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge’s door. Then he returned\\nto the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going\\nto do next.\\nHarry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long,\\nand Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within\\nreach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments\\nshe had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the\\nmarks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped\\nthere. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.\\nOnce they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and\\nsurrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out\\nunder the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as\\nplanned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descend-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n249\\ning mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he\\nstood.\\n“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested Ron, when Harry\\narrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the\\nsingle word, dementors.\\n“I couldn’t... make one,” he panted, clutching the stitch in his side.\\n“Wouldn’t... come.”\\nTheir expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel\\nashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors glid-\\ning out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold\\nchoked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not\\ngoing to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry’s willpower to\\nuproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide\\namongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assu-\\nredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went.\\n“So we still haven’t got any food.”\\n“Shut up, Ron,” snapped Hermione. “Harry, what happened? Why do you\\nthink you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yes-\\nterday!”\\n“I don’t know.”\\nHe sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by\\nthe moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him.\\nYesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been thirteen years\\nold again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.\\nRon kicked a chair leg.\\n“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had since I bled\\nhalf to death is a couple of toadstools!”\\n“You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said Harry,\\nstung.\\n“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”\\n“That’s convenient.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n250\\n“And what’s that supposed to –?”\\n“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startl-\\ning both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket! Come on,” she\\nsaid impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, “the\\nHorcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!”\\nShe held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head.\\nThe moment it parted contact with Harry’s skin he felt free and oddly light.\\nHe had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy\\nweight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.\\n“Better?” asked Hermione. “Yeah, loads better!”\\n“Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of\\nvoice he associated with visiting the very sick, “you don’t think you’ve been\\npossessed, do you?”\\n“What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything we’ve done\\nwhile I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been po-\\nssessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t re-\\nmember anything.”\\n“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket. “Well,\\nmaybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.”\\n“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated firmly. “If\\nwe lose it, if it gets stolen –”\\n“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it around her own\\nneck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. “But we’ll take\\nturns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.”\\n“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can we please\\nget some food?”\\n“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said Hermione with half a\\nglance at Harry. “There’s no point staying where we know dementors are\\nswooping around.”\\nIn the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging\\nto a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n251\\n“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they\\ndevoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money under the\\nchicken coop?”\\nRon rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “‘Er-my-nee, ‘oo\\nworry ‘oo much. ‘Elax!”\\nAnd, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably\\nwell fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that\\nnight, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three\\nnight watches.\\nThis was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good\\nspirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by\\nthis, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys’.\\nHermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to\\nscavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little\\nshorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always\\nbeen used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the\\nHogwarts houseelves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and\\nirascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron’s turn to wear the\\nHorcrux, he became downright unpleasant.\\n“So where next?” was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any\\nideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans\\nwhile he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry\\nand Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find\\nthe other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already got, their\\nconversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new inform-\\nation.\\nAs Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden\\nthe Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of\\ndreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited.\\nThe orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had\\nbeen educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after completing\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n252\\nschool; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed\\nthe basis of their speculations.\\n“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to\\nsearch an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically.\\n“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his Horcruxes\\nbefore he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the\\nsixth,” said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not in Albania, it’s usually\\nwith Vol –”\\n“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”\\n“Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who – happy?”\\n“Not particularly.”\\n“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, who\\nhad made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the\\nnasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they\\nwould’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.”\\nRon yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at\\nhim, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden something at\\nHogwarts.”\\nHermione sighed.\\n“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”\\nHarry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory.\\n“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of\\nHogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol –”\\n“Oi!”\\n“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If\\nthere was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was\\nHogwarts!”\\n“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school?”\\n“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was\\nspecial; it meant everything to him, and even after he left –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n253\\n“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?” inquired\\nRon. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry\\nwas visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.\\n“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job\\nafter he left,” said Hermione.\\n“That’s right,” said Harry.\\n“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find\\nsomething, probably another founder’s object, to make into another Hor-\\ncrux?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\\n“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the\\nchance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!”\\n“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”\\nWithout any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath\\nthe Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had\\nbeen raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records\\nthat the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site\\nand found a tower block of offices.\\n“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested half-\\nheartedly.\\n“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had known it\\nall along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determ-\\nined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dum-\\nbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in\\nhis hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as\\nyou could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Grin-\\ngotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.\\nEven without any new ideas, they continued to move through the country-\\nside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every\\nmorning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence,\\nthen set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n254\\nto more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-\\ncovered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve\\nhours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were\\nplaying some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they\\ndreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of\\nincreased fear and anxiety.\\nHarry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he\\nwas wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to\\nthe pain.\\n“What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry\\nwince.\\n“A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. The thief who\\nstole from Gregorovitch.”\\nAnd Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment.\\nHarry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of\\nthe Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial;\\nhe could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to\\nwhatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on\\nthe unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts,\\nHarry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s scar con-\\ntinued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his\\nmemory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other\\ntwo showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could\\nnot entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Hor-\\ncruxes.\\nAs the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and\\nHermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several\\ntimes they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice\\nhe came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads toge-\\nther and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was\\napproaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n255\\nHarry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come\\non what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought\\nhe had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was mak-\\ning no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Her-\\nmione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried\\nto think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to\\noccur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all\\nlikely, he stopped suggesting it.\\nAutumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it: They were\\nnow pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those\\ncast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that\\nHermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether\\ncompensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s com-\\npany, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Vol-\\ndemort.\\n“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in\\nWales, “can make good food appear out of thin air.”\\nHe prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry\\nglanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he had expected, the gold-\\nen chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the im-\\npulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly\\nwhen the time came to take off the locket.\\n“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No\\none can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of\\nElemental Transfigur –”\\n“Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone out from\\nbetween his teeth.\\n“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it\\nif you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity\\nif you’ve already got some –”\\n“Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n256\\n“Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m always the\\none who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl, I suppose!”\\n“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot back\\nRon. Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto\\nthe floor.\\n“You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients\\nand try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and\\npull faces and moan and you can see how you –”\\n“Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands.\\n“Shut up now!”\\nHermione looked outraged.\\n“How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook –”\\n“Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!”\\nHe was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk.\\nThen, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices\\nagain. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving.\\n“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to Her-\\nmione. “I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, Muggle-Repell-\\ning and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be able to hear or\\nsee us, whoever they are.”\\nHeavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones\\nand twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep,\\nwooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the\\ntent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast\\naround themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield\\nthem from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these\\nwere Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by\\nDark Magic for the first time.\\nThe voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men\\nreached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty\\nfeet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Her-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n257\\nmione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment\\nshe drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron,\\nwho hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and\\nfed the other ends out of the tent entrance.\\nWithin seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.\\n“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too early in\\nthe season? Accio Salmon!”\\nThere were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish\\nagainst flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extend-\\nable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make\\nout more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language\\nhe had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattl-\\ning, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly\\nlower, slower voice than the other.\\nA fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows pass-\\ned between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted\\ntantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates,\\nand the first man spoke again.\\n“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”\\nGoblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. “Thank you,” said\\nthe goblins together in English.\\n“So, you three have been on the run how long?” asked a new, mellow,\\nand pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-\\nbellied, cheerful-faced man.\\n“Six weeks... seven... I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up with Grip-\\nhook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after.\\nNice to have a bit of company.” There was a pause, while knives scraped\\nplates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. “What made\\nyou leave, Ted?” continued the man.\\n“Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry\\nsuddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. “Heard Death Eaters were in\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n258\\nthe area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to register as a\\nMuggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d\\nhave to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And\\nthen I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?”\\n“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each\\nother, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized\\nthe voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.\\n“Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man.\\n“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I’ve got\\nno proof he was a wizard, though.”\\nThere was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then\\nTed spoke again.\\n“I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surp-\\nrised.\\nWord was you’d been caught.”\\n“I was,” said Dirk. “I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for\\nit, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you’d think;\\nI don’t reckon he’s quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so,\\nI’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved\\nmy life.”\\nThere was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed\\non. Then Ted said, “And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression\\nthe goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.”\\n“You had a false impression,” said the higher-voiced of the goblins. “We\\ntake no sides. This is a wizards’ war.”\\n“How come you’re in hiding, then?”\\n“I deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin. “Having refused\\nwhat I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety\\nwas in jeopardy.”\\n“What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted.\\n“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his voice\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n259\\nrougher and less human as he said it. “I am not a house-elf.”\\n“What about you, Griphook?”\\n“Similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. “Gringotts is no longer\\nunder the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.”\\nHe added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk\\nlaughed.\\n“What’s the joke?” asked Dean.\\n“He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards don’t recognize,\\neither.”\\nThere was a short pause. “I don’t get it,” said Dean.\\n“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English.\\n“Good man – goblin, I should say,” amended Ted hastily. “Didn’t\\nmanage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I\\nsuppose?”\\n“If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,” replied\\nGriphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.\\n“Dean and I are still missing something here,” said Ted.\\n“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and\\nthe two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry’s\\nbreathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each\\nother, listening as hard as they could.\\n“Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About the kids who tried\\nto steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at Hogwarts?”\\nAn electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every\\nnerve as he stood rooted to the spot.\\n“Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, was it?”\\n“Hardly,” chortled Dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard about it from\\nBill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the\\nsword was Bill’s younger sister.”\\nHarry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching\\nthe Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n260\\n“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed open\\nthe glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught\\nthem as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.”\\n“Ah, God bless ‘em,” said Ted. “What did they think, that they’d be able\\nto use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself?”\\n“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape\\ndecided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of days\\nlater, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it\\ndown to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.”\\nThe goblins started to laugh again.\\n“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted. “It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook.\\n“The sword of Gryffindor!”\\n“Oh yes. It is a copy – an excellent copy, it is true – but it was Wizard-\\nmade. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain\\nproperties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword\\nof Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.”\\n“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother telling the Death Eaters\\nthis?”\\n“I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said Griphook\\nsmugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk’s laughter.\\nInside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question\\nhe needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he\\nwas (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny’s too.\\n“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal it?”\\n“Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook indifferently.\\n“They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasleys don’t\\nneed any more of their kids injured, do they?”\\n“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said Griphook.\\n“Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose we\\nshould just be glad they’re still alive.”\\n“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked Dirk. “You believe\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n261\\nSnape killed Dumbledore?”\\n“‘Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there and tell me you\\nthink Potter had anything to do with it?”\\n“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk.\\n“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real thing – the\\nChosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”\\n“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk, “me\\nincluded. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You’d think,\\nif he knew anything we don’t, or had anything special going for him, he’d\\nbe out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you\\nknow, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him –”\\n“The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserve to be lied to if you’re still\\nreading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.”\\nThere was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal\\nof thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he\\nspluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood’s?”\\n“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it a look.\\nXeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not a single mention of\\nCrumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they’ll let him get\\naway with it, mind, I don’t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue,\\nthat any wizard who’s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping\\nHarry Potter their number-one priority.”\\n“Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,” said Dirk.\\n“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achieve-\\nment,” said Ted. “I’d take tips from him gladly; it’s what we’re trying to do,\\nstay free, isn’t it?”\\n“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With the\\nwhole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I’d have\\nexpected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they haven’t already\\ncaught and killed him without publicizing it?”\\n“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n262\\nThere was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks.\\nWhen they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the\\nbank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give\\nbetter cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the\\nincline, their voices fading away.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had\\nfound the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they\\neavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, “Ginny – the\\nsword –”\\n“I know!” said Hermione.\\nShe lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right\\nup to the armpit.\\n“Here... we... are...” she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at\\nsomething that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of\\nan ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they\\nlifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she\\nkept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.\\n“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in\\nDumbledore’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting against the\\nside of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right\\nbeside the case!”\\n“Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath as Her-\\nmione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its\\ncenter, cleared her throat, then said:\\n“Er – Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?” Nothing happened.\\n“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black? Please\\ncould we talk to you? Please?”\\n“‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus\\nslid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:\\n“Obscuro!”\\nA black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark eyes,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n263\\ncausing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.\\n“What – how dare – what are you –?”\\n“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a necessary\\nprecaution!”\\n“Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a\\ngreat work of art! Where am I? What is going on?”\\n“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze,\\nabandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.\\n“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?”\\n“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus’s\\ninterest. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you – about the sword of\\nGryffindor.”\\n“Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an\\neffort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely\\nthere–”\\n“Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus raised\\nsupercilious eyebrows.\\n“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side. “Your\\ntone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme.\\nThieving from the headmaster!”\\n“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t Snape’s.”\\n“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Exactly\\nwhat claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment,\\nas did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!”\\n“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said Hermione.\\n“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the\\nblindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me\\nfrom the house of my forebears?”\\n“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?”\\nasked Harry urgently.\\n“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n264\\nfor the oaf, Hagrid.”\\n“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly.\\n“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said Harry, “but\\nGinny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The\\nForbidden Forest... they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest,\\nbig deal!”\\nHe felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at\\nthe very least.\\n“What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else\\nhas, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning\\nor – or something?”\\nPhineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and snigg-\\nered.\\n“Muggle-borns,” he said. “Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning,\\nsimple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which\\nstrengthens it.”\\n“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry.\\n“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps it is\\ntime for me to return to the headmaster’s office?”\\nStill blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his\\nway out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden\\ninspiration.\\n“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?”\\n“I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.\\n“Professor Dumbledore’s portrait – couldn’t you bring him along, here,\\ninto yours?”\\nPhineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s voice.\\n“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The\\nportraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot\\ntravel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging\\nelsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n265\\nI have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall not be making a\\nreturn visit!”\\nSlightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave\\nhis frame.\\n“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please,\\nwhen was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny\\ntook it out, I mean?”\\nPhineas snorted impatiently.\\n“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case\\nwas when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.”\\nHermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say\\nmore in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the\\nexit. “Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began to\\nmove out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view\\nwhen Harry gave a sudden shout.\\n“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?”\\nPhineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture.\\n“Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many\\neccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!”\\nAnd with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but\\nhis murky backdrop.\\n“Harry!” Hermione cried.\\n“I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air;\\nit was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent,\\nfeeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore.\\nHermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded\\nbag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a\\nshining face to Harry.\\n“The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that\\nwhich strengthen them – Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk\\nvenom!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n266\\n“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he\\nwanted to use it on the locket –”\\n“– and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in\\nhis will –”\\n“– so he made a copy –”\\n“– and put a fake in the glass case –”\\n“– and he left the real one – where?”\\nThey gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling\\ninvisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dumbledore\\ntold him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the\\ntime?\\n“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have left it?”\\n“Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing.\\n“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione.\\n“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in there.”\\n“But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?”\\n“Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her.\\n“Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said Hermione.\\n“Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the\\nthought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint,\\nabout Snape’s trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden the sword well\\naway from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon, Ron? Ron?”\\nHarry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron\\nhad left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower\\nbunk, looking stony.\\n“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said. “What?”\\nRon snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. “You two\\ncarry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.”\\nPerplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head,\\napparently as nonplussed as he was.\\n“What’s the problem?” asked Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n267\\n“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry.\\n“Not according to you, anyway.”\\nThere were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started\\nto rain.\\n“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. “Spit it out, will\\nyou?”\\nRon swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike\\nhimself.\\n“All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent\\nbecause there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. Just add it to the\\nlist of stuff you don’t know.”\\n“I don’t know?” repeated Harry. “I don’t know?”\\nPlunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered\\non the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through\\nthe dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he\\nhad suspected and feared him to be thinking.\\n“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron, “you\\nknow, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside\\noff every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a\\nfew weeks, we’d have achieved something.”\\n“Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend\\nnot to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the\\ntent.\\n“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry. “Yeah, I\\nthought I did too.”\\n“So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?” asked Harry.\\nAnger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d be staying in\\nfive-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d\\nbe back to Mummy by Christmas?”\\n“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted Ron, standing up,\\nand his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We thought Dumbledore\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n268\\nhad told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!”\\n“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering\\non the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.\\n“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm even\\nthough he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with you from the\\nstart, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven’t\\nnoticed, we’ve found one Horcrux –”\\n“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the\\nrest of them – nowhere effing near, in other words!”\\n“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high.\\n“Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been\\nwearing it all day.”\\n“Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron.\\n“D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?\\nD’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?”\\n“Harry, we weren’t –”\\n“Don’t lie!” Ron hurled at her. “You said it too, you said you were\\ndisappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than –”\\n“I didn’t say it like that – Harry, I didn’t!” she cried.\\nThe rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s\\nface, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had\\nnever been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving every-\\nthing dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew\\nnot where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement\\nwas not, yet, to be dead.\\n“So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron.\\n“Search me,” said Ron.\\n“Go home then,” said Harry.\\n“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward\\nHarry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they said about my\\nsister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the Forbidden Forest,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n269\\nHarry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t care what happens to her in here –\\nwell, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff –”\\n“I was only saying – she was with the others, they were with Hagrid –”\\n“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the\\nWeasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that?”\\n“Yeah, I –”\\n“Not bothered what it meant, though?”\\n“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think it\\nmeans anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think,\\nRon, Bill’s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George\\nhas lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with\\nspattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant –”\\n“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about\\nthem. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the\\nway –”\\n“My parents are dead!” Harry bellowed.\\n“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.\\n“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over\\nyour spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and –”\\nRon made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand\\nwas clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.\\n“Protego!” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and\\nHarry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced back-\\nward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from\\neither side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other\\nclearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Some-\\nthing had broken between them.\\n“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said.\\nRon wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a\\nnearby chair. He turned to Hermione.\\n“What are you doing?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n270\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“Are you staying, or what?”\\n“I...” She looked anguished. “Yes – yes, I’m staying. Ron, we said we’d\\ngo with Harry, we said we’d help –”\\n“I get it. You choose him.”\\n“Ron, no – please – come back, come back!”\\nShe was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed\\nit he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent,\\nlistening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the trees.\\nAfter a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.\\n“He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated!”\\nShe threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.\\nHarry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around\\nhis own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s bunk and threw them over\\nHermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark\\ncanvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n271\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\\nGODRIC’S HOLLOW\\nW\\nhen Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he\\nremembered what had happened. Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been\\na dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head\\non his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in\\nthe way it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed,\\nkeeping his eyes averted from Ron’s. Hermione, who was already busy in\\nthe kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away\\nquickly as he went by.\\nHe’s gone, Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to keep thinking it as\\nhe washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it. He’s\\ngone and he’s not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it, Harry\\nknew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be imposs-\\nible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again.\\nHe and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione’s eyes were puffy\\nand red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Her-\\nmione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the\\nriverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she\\nhad deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n272\\nrain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry\\nimitated her, looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself)\\nand saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded\\ninside him. He could hear Ron saying, “We thought you knew what you\\nwere doing!”, and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his\\nstomach.\\nThe muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill\\nover onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usu-\\nally have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the bea-\\nded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to\\ndelay: She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a\\nwindswept heather-covered hillside.\\nThe instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s hand and walked\\naway from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees,\\nshaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he\\nought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot.\\nEverything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous\\nexpression on Ron’s face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in\\na large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells\\nshe usually performed to ensure their protection.\\nThey did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was deter-\\nmined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that\\nit was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she\\nthought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had\\nstarted bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight. He\\nwas waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the\\ncorridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable\\ncastle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear\\non the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to\\nstare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the inten-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n273\\nsity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would\\nsomehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.\\nBy day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible\\nlocations of Gryffindor’s sword, but the more they talked about the places\\nin which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-\\nfetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry\\ncould not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might\\nhide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he\\nwas angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you\\nwere doing... We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do... We\\nthought you had a real plan!\\nHe could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had\\nleft him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they\\nhad no means of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had\\never been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to\\nthink of his own presumption in accepting his friends’ offers to accompany\\nhim on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no\\nideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that\\nHermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was\\nleaving.\\nThey were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took\\nto bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as\\nthough he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron’s departure. Despite\\nhis previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nige-\\nllus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry\\nwas up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so.\\nHarry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide\\nand taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at\\nHogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated\\nSnape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n274\\nschool, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questi-\\nons about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.\\nHowever, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a\\nconstant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been\\nbanned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge’s old\\ndecree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial\\nstudent societies.\\nFrom all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville\\nand Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumble-\\ndore’s Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt\\nlike a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dum-\\nbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-\\ngirlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape’s crackdown,\\nHarry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply\\ngoing back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s regime: Being\\nfed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge, seemed the\\nmost wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. But then he remem-\\nbered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-\\nGalleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was\\njust as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas\\nNigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions\\nabout Harry and Hermione’s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back insi-\\nde the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably\\nrefused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious good-byes.\\nThe weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any one\\narea too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard\\nground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up\\nand down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the\\ntent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a\\ntiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent\\nin the night.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n275\\nThey had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting\\nroom windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to\\nsuggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them.\\nThey had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a super-\\nmarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into\\nan open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuad-\\nable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.\\nHe had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break\\nfrom wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk\\nbeside him.\\n“Hermione?”\\n“Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The\\nTales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could\\nget out of the book, which was not, after all, very long; but evidently she\\nwas still deciphering something in it, because Spellman’s Syllabary lay\\nopen on the arm of the chair.\\nHarry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion,\\nseveral years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether\\nhe could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the\\nDursleys to sign his permission slip.\\n“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and –”\\n“Harry, could you help me with something?”\\nApparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and\\nheld out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\\n“Look at that symbol,” she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what\\nHarry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he\\ncould not be sure), there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye,\\nits pupil crossed with a vertical line.\\n“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.”\\n“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary, either. All\\nalong I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it is! It’s been\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n276\\ninked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really part of the book.\\nThink, have you ever seen it before?”\\n“No... No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the same sym-\\nbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?”\\n“Well, that’s what I thought too!”\\n“Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.” She stared at him, openmouthed.\\n“What?”\\n“Krum told me...”\\nHe recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding.\\nHermione looked astonished. “Grindelwald’s mark?”\\nShe looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. “I’ve never\\nheard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it in anything\\nI’ve ever read about him.”\\n“Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at\\nDurmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.”\\nShe fell back into the old armchair, frowning.\\n“That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing in a\\nbook of children’s stories?”\\n“Yeah, it is weird,” said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour would have\\nrecognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.”\\n“I know... Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other\\nstories have little pictures over the titles.”\\nShe did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry\\ntried again.\\n“Hermione?”\\n“Hmm?”\\n“I’ve been thinking. I – I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”\\nShe looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she\\nwas still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book.\\n“Yes,” she said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think we’ll\\nhave to.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n277\\n“Did you hear me right?” he asked.\\n“Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I think we\\nshould. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be either. It’ll be dan-\\ngerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it’s there.”\\n“Er – what’s there?” asked Harry.\\nAt that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.\\n“Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want to\\ngo back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor’s birth-\\nplace –”\\n“Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?”\\n“Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?”\\n“Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months: The\\nmuscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I might’ve opened it, you know, when\\nI bought it... just the once “\\n“Well, as the village is named after him I’d have thought you might have\\nmade the connection,” said Hermione. She sounded much more like her old\\nself than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she\\nwas off to the library. “There’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic,\\nwait…”\\nShe opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting\\nher copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda\\nBagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted.\\n“’Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in\\n1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps,\\nthat they formed their own small communities within a commu-\\nnity. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical\\nfamilies, who banded together for mutual support and protection.\\nThe villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in York-\\nshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were\\nnotable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived along-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n278\\nside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celeb-\\nrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric’s\\nHollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric\\nGryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding\\nsmith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the\\nnames of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt,\\nfor the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church\\nbeside it for many centuries.’”\\n“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing the\\nbook, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end\\nof the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gry-\\nffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dumbledore would have\\nexpected you to make the connection?”\\n“Oh yeah...”\\nHarry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword\\nat all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of\\nthe village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly\\nescaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.\\n“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually. “Who?”\\n“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s\\ngreat-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”\\n“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had\\nsensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:\\n“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”\\n“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index finger over\\nBathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. “Well,\\nI suppose –”\\nShe gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew his\\nwand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing\\nits way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n279\\n“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did you do that for? I\\nthought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least –”\\n“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted\\nit to her?”\\nHarry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old\\nwoman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it likely that\\nDumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so,\\nHarry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had\\nnever revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so\\nmuch as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the\\nmoment to cast doubt on Hermione’s theory, not when she was so surpris-\\ningly willing to fall in with Harry’s dearest wish.\\n“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s Hollow?”\\n“Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.” She was sitting\\nup now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had\\nlifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to practice Disapparating toge-\\nther under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps Disillusionment\\nCharms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog\\nand use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we’ll need to collect hair from\\nsomebody. I actually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our dis-\\nguises the better “\\nHarry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but\\nhis mind had left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered\\nthat the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.\\nHe was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had\\na family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have\\ngrown up and spent every school holiday. He could have invited friends to\\nhis house... He might even have had brothers and sisters... It would have\\nbeen his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he\\nhad lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he\\nknew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n280\\nHermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack\\nfrom Hermione’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album\\nHagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused\\nthe old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the\\nimages, which were all he had left of them now.\\nHarry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following day,\\nbut Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would\\nexpect Harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths, she was deter-\\nmined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the\\nbest disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later – once they had\\nsurreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas\\nshopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while under-\\nneath the Invisibility Cloak together – that Hermione agreed to make the\\njourney.\\nThey were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was\\nlate afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry trans-\\nforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small\\nand rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their possessions\\n(apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was\\ntucked into an inside pocket of Hermione’s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered\\nthe Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating dark-\\nness once again.\\nHeart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing\\nhand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night’s\\nfirst stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of\\nthe narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short\\nway ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the\\nvillage.\\n“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “Why didn’t we\\nthink of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have\\nto get rid of them – you go in front, I’ll do it –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n281\\nHarry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to\\nkeep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces.\\n“Let’s take off the Cloak,” said Harry, and when she looked frightened,\\n“Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one around.”\\nHe stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward\\nunhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages:\\nAny one of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once\\nlived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their\\nsnowburdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether he remem-\\nbered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had\\nbeen little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. He was\\nnot even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not\\nknow what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the\\nlittle lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of\\nthe village, a small square, was revealed to them.\\nStrung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war\\nmemorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree.\\nThere were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose\\nstained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright across the square.\\nThe snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where\\npeople had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of\\nthem, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. They heard a snatch\\nof laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then they\\nheard a carol start up inside the little church.\\n“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione. “Is it?”\\nHe had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks.\\n“I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. “They... they’ll\\nbe in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard\\nbehind it.”\\nHarry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like\\nfear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n282\\nall. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached for\\nhis hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway\\nacross the square, however, she stopped dead.\\n“Harry, look!”\\nShe was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had\\ntransformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of\\nthree people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair\\nand a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother’s arms. Snow\\nlay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.\\nHarry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had never ima-\\ngined that there would be a statue... How strange it was to see himself repre-\\nsented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead...\\n“C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again\\ntoward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder;\\nthe statue had turned back into the war memorial.\\nThe singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry’s\\nthroat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves\\nbellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great\\nHall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won\\nin a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater...\\nThere was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione\\npushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either\\nside of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and un-\\ntouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind\\nthem as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath\\nthe brilliant windows.\\nBehind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a\\nblanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green\\nwherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his\\nhand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved toward\\nthe nearest grave.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n283\\n“Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hann-\\nah’s!”\\n“Keep your voice down,” Hermione begged him.\\nThey waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks\\ninto the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones,\\nevery now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make abso-\\nlutely sure that they were unaccompanied.\\n“Harry, here!”\\nHermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her,\\nhis heart positively banging in his chest.\\n“Is it –?”\\n“No, but look!”\\nShe pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the\\nfrozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and,\\na short way below her dates of birth and death, AND HER DAUGHTER\\nARIANA. There was also a quotation:\\nWhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\\nSo Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dum-\\nbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here.\\nSeeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help\\nthinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and\\nthat Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to\\nshare the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a\\nmoment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that\\nwould have been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed\\nthat to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same\\ngraveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the\\njob he wanted Harry to do.\\nHermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden\\nin shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n284\\nis, there will your heart be also. He did not understand what these words\\nmeant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the\\nfamily once his mother had died.\\n“Are you sure he never mentioned –?” Hermione began.\\n“No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away,\\nwishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation\\ntainted with resentment.\\n“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the\\ndarkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.”\\nShe was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little\\nfrown on her face.\\n“Harry, come back a moment.”\\nHe did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his\\nway back through the snow toward her.\\n“What?”\\n“Look at this!”\\nThe grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make\\nout the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.\\n“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”\\nHe peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was\\nhard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a\\ntriangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.\\n“Yeah... it could be…”\\nHermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. “It\\nsays Ig – Ignotus, I think…”\\n“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” Harry told her, a\\nslight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside\\nthe old grave.\\nEvery now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had\\nmet at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same\\nWizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n285\\ndates that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away\\nfrom Godric’s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and\\nevery time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension\\nand anticipation.\\nThe darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much\\ndeeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized\\nthat the carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were\\nfading away as they made their way back into the square. Somebody inside\\nthe church had just turned off the lights.\\nThen Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp\\nand clear from a few yards away.\\n“Harry, they’re here... right here.”\\nAnd he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He\\nmoved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest,\\nthe same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that\\nhad actually weighed on his heart and lungs.\\nThe headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was\\nmade of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy\\nto read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even\\napproach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.\\nJAMES POTTER LILY POTTER\\nBORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960\\nDIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981\\nThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.\\nHarry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance\\nto take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.\\n“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’...” A horrible thought\\ncame to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn’t that a Death Eater idea? Why\\nis that there?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n286\\n“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it,\\nHarry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means... you know... living\\nbeyond death. Living after death.”\\nBut they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty\\nwords could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering remains lay\\nbeneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he\\ncould stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what\\nwas the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips\\npressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes\\nthe place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust,\\nnot knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still\\nbeating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment,\\nthat he was sleeping under the snow with them.\\nHermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could\\nnot look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of\\nthe night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should\\nhave brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, and\\nevery plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised\\nher wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas\\nroses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’\\ngrave.\\nAs soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could\\nstand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermione’s shoulders,\\nand she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked\\naway through the snow, past Dumbledore’s mother and sister, back toward\\nthe dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n287\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\\n“H\\narry, stop.”\\n“What’s wrong?”\\nThey had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.\\n“There’s someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by\\nthe bushes.”\\nThey stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black\\nboundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything.\\n“Are you sure?”\\n“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did…”\\nShe broke from him to free her wand arm. “We look like Muggles,” Harry\\npointed out.\\n“Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave! Harry,\\nI’m sure there’s someone over there!”\\nHarry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be\\nhaunted: what if –? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of\\ndislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could\\nnot move snow.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n288\\n“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird. If it was a Death\\nEater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here, and we can put the\\nCloak back on.”\\nThey glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the grave-\\nyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reass-\\nuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. They\\npulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was fuller than\\nbefore: Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard\\nas they approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting\\nthey take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione mur-\\nmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out\\nof the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry\\ncould make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into\\nopen country again. They walked as quickly as they dared, past more win-\\ndows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of Christmas trees\\ndark through the curtains.\\n“How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione, who was\\nshivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. “Harry? What\\ndo you think? Harry?”\\nShe tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was look-\\ning toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses.\\nNext moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him; she\\nslipped a little on the ice.\\n“Harry –”\\n“Look... Look at it, Hermione…”\\n“I don’t oh!”\\nHe could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily.\\nThe hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry\\nfrom the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the\\ncottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but\\nthe right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n289\\nwas where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate,\\ngazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those\\nthat flanked it.\\n“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione.\\n“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied. “Maybe it’s like the injuries\\nfrom Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?”\\nHe slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and\\nthickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of\\nthe house.\\n“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might – oh, Harry,\\nlook!”\\nHis touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the\\nground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like\\nsome bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters upon the wood it\\nsaid:\\nOn this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James\\nPotter lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard\\never to have survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to\\nMuggles, has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the\\nPotters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their\\nfamily.\\nAnd all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by\\nother witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy\\nWho Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed their names in Ever-\\nlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had\\nleft messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years’\\nworth of magical graffiti, all said similar things.\\nGood luck, Harry, wherever you are. If you read this, Harry,\\nwe’re all behind you!\\nLong live Harry Potter.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n290\\n“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione, indignant. But\\nHarry beamed at her.\\n“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I...”\\nHe broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward\\nthem, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought,\\nthough it was hard to judge, that the figure was a woman. She was moving\\nslowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, her\\nstoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They\\nwatched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she\\nwould turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinct-\\nively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them\\nand simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.\\nHe did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There was next to no\\nchance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a\\nhouse that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a\\nwitch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior\\nto come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the\\nrules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione\\nand him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew\\nthat they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this\\nuneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned.\\nHermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against\\nhis.\\n“How does she know?”\\nHe shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry\\ncould think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspi-\\ncions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they\\nstood facing each other in the deserted street.\\nWas it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months?\\nThat Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the\\nend? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n291\\ngraveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense\\nthem suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered\\nbefore.\\nFinally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. “Are you\\nBathilda?”\\nThe muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.\\nBeneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry rais-\\ned his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.\\nThey stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled off\\nback the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned\\nin at a gate. They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as\\novergrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a\\nkey at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.\\nShe smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose as\\nthey sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her,\\nhe realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level\\nwith his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and\\nmottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s face.\\nHer eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin,\\nand her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He won-\\ndered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the\\nbalding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.\\nThe odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensi-\\nfied as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant\\nwhite hair through which the scalp showed clearly.\\n“Bathilda?” Harry repeated.\\nShe nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the\\nthing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it\\npulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that\\nwould destroy it was near?\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n292\\nBathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had\\nnot seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.\\n“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione.\\n“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,”\\nsaid Harry. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all there.\\nMuriel called her ‘gaga.’”\\n“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room. Hermione jumped and\\nclutched Harry’s arm.\\n“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting\\nroom.\\nBathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still\\nvery dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their\\nfeet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell,\\nsomething worse, like meat gone bad. He wondered when was the last time\\nanyone had been inside Bathilda’s house to check whether she was coping.\\nShe seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the\\ncandles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catch-\\ning fire.\\n“Let me do that,” offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She\\nstood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on\\nsaucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on\\nside tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.\\nThe last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest\\nof drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the\\nflame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver.\\nHe saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with\\nlogs for the fire, he muttered “Tergeo”: The dust vanished from the photo-\\ngraphs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest\\nand most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else\\nhad removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the coll-\\nection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n293\\nIt was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had per-\\nched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the\\nsilver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy\\nbefore: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the\\nteenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs\\nwere: in Rita’s book.\\n“Mrs. – Miss – Bagshot?” he said, and his voice shook slightly. “Who is\\nthis?”\\nBathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light\\nthe fire for her.\\n“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his\\nhands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his\\nvoice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest.\\n“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. She\\npeered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.\\n“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and louder\\nvoice than usual. “This man? Do you know him? What’s he called?”\\nBathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had\\nRita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories?\\n“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly. “Harry, what are you doing?”\\nasked Hermione.\\n“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregor-\\novitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. “Who is this?”\\nBut she only stared at him.\\n“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. – Miss – Bagshot?” asked\\nHermione, raising her own voice. “Was there something you wanted to tell\\nus?”\\nGiving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few\\nsteps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the\\nhall.\\n“You want us to leave?” he asked.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n294\\nShe repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself,\\nthen at the ceiling.\\n“Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.”\\n“All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.”\\nBut when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising\\nvigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.\\n“She wants me to go with her, alone.”\\n“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the\\ncandlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.\\n“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?”\\n“Do you really think she knows who you are?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own,\\n“I think she does.”\\n“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.”\\n“Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda.\\nShe seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the\\ndoor. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was\\nnot sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candle-\\nlit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room,\\nunseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photo-\\ngraph of the unknown thief inside his jacket.\\nThe stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his\\nhands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not topple over\\nbackward on top of him, which seemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a\\nlittle, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and led\\nhim into a low-ceilinged bedroom.\\nIt was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a cham-\\nber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and\\neven that was swallowed by the darkness.\\n“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start: Bathilda had\\nmoved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n295\\nher approach.\\n“You are Potter?” she whispered. “Yes, I am.”\\nShe nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster\\nthan his own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation.\\n“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed distracted\\nby his lit wand-tip.\\n“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated.\\nThen she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry’s\\nscar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater\\nactually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap\\nof joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold him!\\nHarry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to\\nclose around him again; he did not know what had just happened.\\n“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time, much louder.\\n“Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand\\nand saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained\\nwindow.\\nThis time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade\\nbed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away from her.\\n“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped\\nhigh with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.\\n“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.\\nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess\\nfor a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of\\nhis eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old\\nbody collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck\\nhad been.\\nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his fore-\\narm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly\\naround the room and was extinguished: Then a powerful blow from the tail\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n296\\nto his midriff knocked the breath out of him: He fell backward onto the\\ndressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing –\\nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, which thrashed\\ndown upon the table where he had been a second earlier: Fragments of the\\nglass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor. From below he heard Her-\\nmione call, “Harry?”\\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy\\nsmooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, power-\\nful, muscular –\\n“No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor.\\n“Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss... hold you... hold you...”\\n“Accio... Accio Wand...”\\nBut nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake\\nfrom him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him,\\npressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with\\nlife, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was flooding with cold,\\nwhite light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant foot-\\nsteps, everything going...\\nA metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying,\\nflying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral...\\nHe was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had re-\\nleaseed him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the\\nlanding light: It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her\\ndeflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air filled\\nthe room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his\\nfoot slipped on a pencil-like something – his wand –\\nHe bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its\\ntail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry\\nthought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light,\\nand the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went,\\ncoil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n297\\nhe did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done\\nin years.\\n“He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming!”\\nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It sma-\\nshed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry\\njumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione –\\nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake\\nreared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was\\nperhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with the pain\\nfrom his scar –\\nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with\\nhim; as it struck, Hermione screamed, “Confringo!” and her spell flew\\naround the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at\\nthem, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back\\nof his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt\\nfrom bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed\\nwindow into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as\\nthey twisted in midair...\\nAnd then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running\\nacross the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill\\nas he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish, and he\\nscreamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl’s, that echoed\\nacross the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day...\\nAnd his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was Harry’s pain... that it\\ncould happen here, where it had happened before... here, within sight of that\\nhouse where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die to die...\\nThe pain was so terrible... ripped from his body... But if he had no body,\\nwhy did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how could he feel so\\nunbearably, didn’t pain cease with death, didn’t it go...\\nThe night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling\\nacross the square, and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n298\\ntawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe... And he\\nwas gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that\\nhe always knew on these occasions... Not anger... that was for weaker souls\\nthan he... but triumph, yes... He had waited for this, he had hoped for it...\\n“Nice costume, mister!”\\nHe saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath\\nthe hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then the child\\nturned and ran away... Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand...\\nOne simple movement and the child would never reach his mother... but\\nunnecessary, quite unnecessary...\\nAnd along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination\\nwas in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it\\nyet... And he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pave-\\nment as he drew level with the dark hedge, and stared over it...\\nThey had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little\\nsitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of color-\\ned smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired\\nboy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and trying to catch the\\nsmoke, to grab it in his small fist...\\nA door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear,\\nher long dark-red hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the\\nson and handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa\\nand stretched, yawning...\\nThe gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not\\nhear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it\\nat the door, which burst open.\\nHe was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was\\neasy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand...\\n“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off!”\\nHold him off, without a wand in his hand!... He laughed before casting\\nthe curse...\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n299\\n“Avada Kedavra!”\\nThe green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against\\nthe wall, it made the banisters glare like lightning rods, and James Potter\\nfell like a marionette whose strings were cut...\\nHe could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as\\nshe was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear... He climbed the steps,\\nlistening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in She\\nhad no wand upon her either... How stupid they were, and how trusting,\\nthinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded\\neven for moments...\\nHe forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled\\nagainst it with one lazy wave of his wand and there she stood, the child in\\nher arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib behind her\\nand threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him from\\nsight she hoped to be chosen instead...\\n“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”\\n“Stand aside, you silly girl stand aside, now.”\\n“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead –”\\n“This is my last warning –”\\n“Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy... Not Harry! Not Harry!\\nPlease – I’ll do anything –”\\n“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!”\\nHe could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent\\nto finish them all...\\nThe green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her hus-\\nband. The child had not cried all this time: He could stand, clutching the\\nbars of his crib, and he looked up into the intruder’s face with a kind of\\nbright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the\\ncloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment,\\nlaughing –\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n300\\nHe pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face: He wanted to see\\nit happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began\\nto cry: It had seen that he was not James. He did not like it crying, he had\\nnever been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage –\\n“Avada Kedavra!”\\nAnd then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he\\nmust hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the\\nchild was trapped and screaming, but far away... far away...\\n“No,” he moaned.\\nThe snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy,\\nand yet he was the boy...\\n“No…”\\nAnd now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda’s house, immersed\\nin memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over\\nbroken china and glass... He looked down and saw something... something\\nincredible...\\n“No…”\\n“Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right!”\\nHe stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was,\\nthe unknown thief, the thief he was seeking...\\n“No... I dropped it... I dropped it…”\\n“Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!”\\nHe was Harry... Harry, not Voldemort and the thing that was rustling\\nwas not a snake He opened his eyes.\\n“Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Do you feel all – all right?”\\n“Yes,” he lied.\\nHe was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of\\nblankets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the\\nquality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was drenched in\\nsweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets.\\n“We got away.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n301\\n“Yes,” said Hermione. “I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your\\nbunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been... Well, you haven’t been quite...”\\nThere were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small\\nsponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.\\n“You’ve been ill,” she finished. “Quite ill.”\\n“How long ago did we leave?”\\n“Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.”\\n“And I’ve been... what, unconscious?”\\n“Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortably. “You’ve been shouting and\\nmoaning and... things,” she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy.\\nWhat had he done? Screamed curses like Voldemort, cried like the baby in\\nthe crib?\\n“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, and he knew she\\nwanted to change the subject. “It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You’ve got\\na mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The snake\\nbit you too, but I’ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it “\\nHe pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and\\nlooked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had\\nburned him. He could also see the half-healed puncture marks to his fore-\\narm.\\n“Where’ve you put the Horcrux?”\\n“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.”\\nHe lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face.\\n“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all my\\nfault, Hermione, I’m sorry.”\\n“It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might\\nhave left the sword there for you.”\\n“Yeah, well we got that wrong, didn’t we?”\\n“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs?\\nWas the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and\\nattack you?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n302\\n“No,” he said. “She was the snake... or the snake was her all along.”\\n“W-what?”\\nHe closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made\\nthe whole thing horribly vivid.\\n“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was... was inside her.\\nYou-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right.\\nHe knew I’d go back.”\\n“The snake was inside her?”\\nHe opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.\\n“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said.\\n“She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all\\nParseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her.\\nOnce we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who,\\nI heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me\\nthere... and then...”\\nHe remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did\\nnot need to know the details.\\n“... she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.” He looked down\\nat the puncture marks.\\n“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who\\ncame.”\\nIf he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all\\nof it... Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the covers.\\n“Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!”\\n“You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I’m\\nfine. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand?”\\nShe did not answer, she merely looked at him. “Where’s my wand, Her-\\nmione?”\\nShe was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. “Harry...”\\n“Where’s my wand?”\\nShe reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n303\\nThe holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile\\nstrand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had\\nsplintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as though it was a\\nliving thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think properly:\\nEverything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the wand to Her-\\nmione.\\n“Mend it. Please.”\\n“Harry, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this –”\\n“Please, Hermione, try!”\\n“R-Reparo.”\\nThe dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up.\\n“Lumos!”\\nThe wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione.\\n“Expelliarmus!”\\nHermione’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble\\nattempt at magic was too much for Harry’s wand, which split into two again.\\nHe stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing... the wand that\\nhad survived so much...\\n“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “I’m\\nso, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake\\nwas coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded every-\\nwhere, and it must have – must have hit –”\\n“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned.\\n“We’ll – we’ll find a way to repair it.”\\n“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione, the tears\\ntrickling down her face. “Remember... remember Ron? When he broke his\\nwand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to get a new\\none.”\\nHarry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort;\\nof Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a\\nnew wand?\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n304\\n“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, I’ll just borrow\\nyours for now, then. While I keep watch.”\\nHer face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left\\nher sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n305\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\\nTHE LIFE AND LIES OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\nT\\nhe sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the sky stretch-\\ned over him, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent\\nentrance and took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the\\nsun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest\\ntreasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked\\nby the calamity of losing his wand. He looked out over a valley blanketed\\nin snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence.\\nWithout realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were\\ntrying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than\\nhe could count; he had lost all the bones in his right arm once; this journey\\nhad already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his\\nhand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be\\nfatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magi-\\ncal power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would\\nsay if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But\\nshe was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like\\nthe needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n306\\nthe protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize\\nhow much he had been counting upon it.\\nHe pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without\\nlooking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid’s pouch around his neck. The\\npouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more.\\nHarry’s hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a\\nmoment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away.\\nImpenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left\\nbehind –\\nAnd his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him\\ninside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had\\ntalked themselves into believing that Godric’s Hollow held answers, con-\\nvinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part\\nof some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map,\\nno plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with\\nunknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was ex-\\nplained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had\\nno wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would\\nsurely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was Voldemort had\\nall the information now...\\n“Harry?”\\nHermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand.\\nHer face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of\\ntea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm.\\n“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups. “Do you mind if I talk to you?”\\n“No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings.\\n“Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well... I’ve\\ngot the book.”\\nTimidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies\\nof Albus Dumbledore.\\n“Where – how –?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n307\\n“It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there... This note was stick-\\ning out of the top of it.”\\nHermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud.\\n“‘Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope you\\nlike it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember it. Rita.’ I think it\\nmust have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t\\nin any fit state to read it?”\\n“No, she probably wasn’t.”\\nHarry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a surge of\\nsavage pleasure: Now he would know all the things that Dumbledore had\\nnever thought it worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or\\nnot.\\n“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione; he looked\\nup to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must\\nhave shown in his face.\\n“No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You\\nwere trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I’d be dead\\nif you hadn’t been there to help me.”\\nHe tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book.\\nIts spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He riffled thr-\\nough the pages, looking for photographs. He came across the one he sought\\nalmost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion,\\nroaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes\\nto the caption.\\nAlbus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death, with his\\nfriend Gellert Grindelwald.\\nHarry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His\\nfriend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still con-\\ntemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she\\nlooked up at Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n308\\n“Grindelwald?”\\nIgnoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages\\naround them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and\\nread greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go further back to make\\nsense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter\\nentitled “The Greater Good.” Together, he and Hermione started to read:\\nNow approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left\\nHogwarts in a blaze of glory – Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the\\nBarnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British\\nYouth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner\\nfor Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemi-\\ncal Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a\\nGrand Tour with Elphias “Dogbreath” Doge, the dimwitted but\\ndevoted sidekick he had picked up at school.\\nThe two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in\\nLondon, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning,\\nwhen an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore’s mother’s\\ndeath. “Dogbreath” Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this\\nbook, has given the public his own sentimental version of what\\nhappened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a tragic blow, and\\nDumbledore’s decision to give up his expedition as an act of\\nnoble self-sacrifice.\\nCertainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at once,\\nsupposedly to “care” for his younger brother and sister. But how\\nmuch care did he actually give them?\\n“He were a head case, that Aberforth,” says Enid Smeek, who-\\nse family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that time.\\n“Ran wild. ‘Course, with his mum and dad gone you’d have felt\\nsorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don’t\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n309\\nthink Albus was fussed about him, I never saw them together,\\nanyway.”\\nSo what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young\\nbrother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued impri-\\nsonment of his sister. For, though her first jailer had died, there\\nwas no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her\\nvery existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders\\nwho, like “Dogbreath” Doge, could be counted upon to believe in\\nthe story of her “ill health.”\\nAnother such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda\\nBagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived in\\nGodric’s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had rebuffed\\nBathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the\\nvillage. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to\\nAlbus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper\\non trans-species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This\\ninitial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore\\nfamily. At the time of Kendra’s death, Bathilda was the only\\nperson in Godric’s Hollow who was on speaking terms with\\nDumbledore’s mother.\\nUnfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in\\nher life has now dimmed. “The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s\\nempty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slight-\\nly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.” Nevertheless, a\\ncombination of tried-andtested reporting techniques enabled me\\nto extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole\\nscandalous story.\\nLike the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra’s\\npremature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by\\nAlbus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the fami-\\nly line on Ariana, calling her “frail” and “delicate.” On one sub-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n310\\nject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into pro-\\ncuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story\\nof the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore’s life. Now revealed\\nfor the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers\\nbelieved of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts,\\nhis opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to\\nhis own family.\\nThe very same summer that Dumbledore went home to God-\\nric’s Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda\\nBagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew, Gellert\\nGrindelwald.\\nThe name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most\\nDangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the\\ntop spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later,\\nto steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign\\nof terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are\\nnot widely known here.\\nEducated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its\\nunfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed him-\\nself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than\\nchannel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes,\\nhowever, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits.\\nAt sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn\\na blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and\\nhe was expelled.\\nHitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald’s next move-\\nments is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” It can now\\nbe revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in God-\\nric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be\\nfor many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other\\nthan Albus Dumbledore.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n311\\n“He seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles Bathilda, “what-\\never he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus,\\nwho was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took\\nto each other at once.”\\nThey certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that\\nAlbus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night.\\n“Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion – both such\\nbrilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire – I’d\\nsometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom window,\\ndelivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him,\\nand he had to let Gellert know immediately!”\\nAnd what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus\\nDumbledore’s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their\\nseventeenyear-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy\\nof the original letter may be seen on page 463.)\\nGellert –\\nYour point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGG-\\nLES’ OWN GOOD – this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we\\nhave been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to\\nrule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must\\nstress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we\\nbuild. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be\\nthe basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE\\nGREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet\\nresistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no\\nmore. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not\\ncomplain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never\\nhave met.)\\nAlbus –\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n312\\nAstonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this\\nletter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of\\noverthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule\\nover Muggles. What a blow for those who have always portrayed\\nDumbledore as the Muggleborns’ greatest champion! How holl-\\now those speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of\\nthis damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus Dum-\\nbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should\\nhave been mourning his mother and caring for his sister!\\nNo doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumb-\\nling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into\\naction, that he must have suffered a change of heart, that he came\\nto his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking.\\nBarely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore\\nand Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they\\nmet for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What\\ncaused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses?\\nHad he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans?\\nAlas, no.\\n“It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” says Bathil-\\nda. “It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house\\nwhen it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither,\\ntold me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed,\\nyou know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of\\nhim.\\n“Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so dreadful\\nfor those two brothers. They had lost everybody except each\\nother. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed\\nAlbus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circum-\\nstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All\\nthe same, breaking Albus’s nose at the funeral was not decent. It\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n313\\nwould have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that,\\nacross her daughter’s body. A shame Gellert could not have\\nstayed for the funeral... He would have been a comfort to Albus,\\nat least…”\\nThis dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who\\nattended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises several questions.\\nWhy exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sis-\\nter’s death? Was it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere effusion of grief?\\nOr could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury?\\nGrindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks\\nupon fellow students, fled the country hours after the girl’s death,\\nand Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until\\nforced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world.\\nNeither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have re-\\nferred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there\\ncan be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of\\nturmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert\\nGrindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of\\nexposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesi-\\ntate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture\\nthe man he was once so delighted he had met?\\nAnd how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inad-\\nvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across some-\\nthing she ought not to have done, as the two young men sat practi-\\ncing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that\\nAriana Dumbledore was the first person to die “for the greater\\ngood”?\\nThe chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the\\nbottom of the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harry’s hands,\\nlooking a little alarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n314\\nit, as though hiding something indecent.\\n“Harry –”\\nBut he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside\\nhim; it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore,\\nbelieved him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How\\nmuch more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand...\\n“Harry.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts. “Listen to me. It – it\\ndoesn’t make very nice reading –”\\n“Yeah, you could say that –”\\n“– but don’t forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing.”\\n“You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you?”\\n“Yes, I – I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold\\nhands. “I think that’s the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just\\ntalk, but ‘For the Greater Good’ became Grindelwald’s slogan, his justi-\\nfication for all the atrocities he committed later. And... from that... it looks\\nlike Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was\\neven carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.”\\n“What’s Nurmengard?”\\n“The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in\\nthere himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it’s – it’s an\\nawful thought that Dumbledore’s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power.\\nBut on the other hand, even Rita can’t pretend that they knew each other for\\nmore than a few months one summer when they were both really young,\\nand –”\\n“I thought you’d say that,” said Harry. He did not want to let his anger\\nspill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. “I thought you’d\\nsay ‘They were young.’ They were the same age as we are now. And here\\nwe are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle\\nwith his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.”\\nHis temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and\\nwalked around, trying to work some of it off.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n315\\n“I’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” said Hermione. “All\\nthat ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all over again. But Harry,\\nhis mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house –”\\n“Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his\\nSquib sister he was keeping locked up –”\\n“I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. “Whatever was\\nwrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we\\nknew would never, ever have allowed –”\\n“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer Muggles\\nby force!” Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and\\nseveral blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiraling against the\\npearly sky.\\n“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe he did\\nbelieve these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his\\nlife was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who\\nstopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle protection and\\nMuggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who\\ndied trying to bring him down!”\\nRita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus\\nDumbledore smiled dolefully at both.\\n“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that\\nDumbledore never told you any of this himself.”\\n“Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head,\\nhardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself\\nfrom the weight of his own disillusionment. “Look what he asked from me,\\nHermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don’t expect\\nme to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m\\ndoing, trust me even though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth!\\nNever!” His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each\\nother in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insig-\\nnificant as insects beneath that wide sky.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n316\\n“He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.” Harry dro-\\npped his arms.\\n“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn’t\\nlove, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was\\nreally thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.”\\nHarry picked up Hermione’s wand, which he had dropped in the snow,\\nand sat back down in the entrance of the tent.\\n“Thanks for the tea. I’ll finish the watch. You get back in the warm.”\\nShe hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and\\nthen walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the\\ntop of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and\\nhated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had\\nreally cared.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n317\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\\nTHE SILVER DOE\\nI\\nt was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight.\\nHarry’s dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of\\nthem, first through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a wreath of Christ-\\nmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had\\ncalled out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around\\nthe tent was footsteps or voices.\\nFinally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled\\nin the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her\\nwand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his\\nsuggestion of packing up early and moving on.\\n“We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she pull-\\ned on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “I kept thinking I could hear people\\nmoving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.”\\nHarry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent,\\nmotionless Sneakoscope on the table.\\n“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The snow in\\nthe dark, it plays tricks on your eyes... But perhaps we ought to Disapparate\\nunder the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n318\\nHalf an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and\\nHermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness\\nengulfed them; Harry’s feet parted company with the snowy ground, then\\nslammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.\\n“Where are we?” he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as\\nHermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles.\\n“The Forest of Dean,” she said. “I came camping here once with my mum\\nand dad.”\\nHere too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they\\nwere at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the\\ntent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione\\nwas so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried\\naround in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief\\nbut severe illness, an impression reinforced by Hermione’s solicitousness.\\nThat afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their shelt-\\nered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.\\nAfter two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert than\\nusual. Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow that Volde-\\nmort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness\\ndrew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to keep watch and told her to\\ngo to bed.\\nHarry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing\\nall the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened\\nwith the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the\\npoint of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as to watch Ginny’s dot for a\\nwhile, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she\\nwould be back at the Burrow.\\nEvery tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest.\\nHarry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would\\nall remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings\\nand prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n319\\nHe remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years\\nago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself.\\nTheir protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they\\nbreak now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was\\ndifferent tonight.\\nSeveral times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen\\nasleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night\\nreached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspend-\\ned in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition. He had just held up a\\nhand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when\\nit happened.\\nA bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the\\ntrees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed\\nsimply to drift toward him.\\nHe jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermi-\\none’s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees\\nin front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer...\\nAnd then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a\\nsilver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the\\nground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow.\\nShe stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes\\nheld high.\\nHarry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness,\\nbut at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her\\nto come, but that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged\\nto meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a\\nmoment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that\\nshe had come for him, and him alone.\\nThey gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned\\nand walked away.\\n“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come back!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n320\\nShe continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her bright-\\nness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he\\nhesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct,\\noverwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in\\npursuit.\\nSnow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed\\nthrough the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the\\nforest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped,\\nshe would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak\\nand the voice would tell him what he needed to know.\\nAt last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once\\nmore, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened\\nhis lips to ask it, she vanished.\\nThough the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was\\nstill imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he\\nlowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had\\nmeant safety.\\n“Lumos!” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.\\nThe imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he\\nstood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs,\\nsoft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him\\ninto an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach\\nof the wandlight, watching him?\\nHe held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light\\nburst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?\\nSomething gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but\\nall that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface glitt-\\nering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.\\nHe moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected\\nhis distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick,\\nmisty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross...\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n321\\nHis heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool’s\\nedge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much\\nlight as possible. A glint of deep red... It was a sword with glittering rubies\\nin its hilt... The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest\\npool.\\nBarely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could\\nit have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they\\nwere camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or\\nwas the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of\\nthe pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived,\\nprecisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who\\nhad wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surround-\\ning trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye,\\nbut he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened\\nhis exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the\\nbottom of the frozen pool.\\nHe pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio Sword.”\\nIt did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword\\nwould have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a\\nfrozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last\\ntime the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger\\nthen, and had asked for help.\\n“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom,\\nindifferent, motionless.\\nWhat was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had\\ntold him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor\\ncould have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that\\ndefined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry’s head answered him:\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.\\nHarry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath\\ndispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n322\\nhonest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment\\nhe had spotted the sword through the ice.\\nHe glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now\\nthat nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walk-\\ned alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined\\nthe pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate\\nprospect was so deeply uninviting.\\nWith fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of cloth-\\ning. Where “chivalry” entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not enti-\\nrely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermi-\\none to do it in his stead.\\nAn owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang\\nof Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he\\ncontinued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted\\nin the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his mother’s letter,\\nthe shard of Sirius’s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he\\npointed Hermione’s wand at the ice.\\n“Diffindo.”\\nIt cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: The surface of the pool\\nbroke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry\\ncould judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to\\nsubmerge himself completely.\\nContemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water war-\\nmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s wand on the\\nground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he was about\\nto become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped.\\nEvery pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his lungs\\nseemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen\\nwater. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently the water lapped over\\nthe edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He only\\nwanted to dive once.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n323\\nHarry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second,\\ngasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all\\nhis courage, and dived.\\nThe cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to\\nhave frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached\\nout, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it\\nupward.\\nThen something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds,\\nthough nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to\\nfree himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and\\nwas slowly constricting his windpipe.\\nHarry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but\\nmerely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffo-\\ncating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to\\nloosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he was\\ngoing to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms\\nthat closed around his chest were surely Death’s...\\nChoking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his\\nlife, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another person\\nwas panting and coughing and staggering around. Hermione had come\\nagain, as she had come when the snake attacked... Yet it did not sound like\\nher, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps...\\nHarry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity. All he\\ncould do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the\\nlocket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone: Someone had cut him free.\\nThen a panting voice spoke from over his head.\\n“Are – you – mental?”\\nNothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the\\nstrength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before\\nhim stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to\\nhis face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n324\\nits broken chain in the other.\\n“Why the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung back-\\nward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t\\nyou take this thing off before you dived?”\\nHarry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared\\nwith Ron’s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he\\ncaught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water’s edge and began to pull\\nthem on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at\\nRon, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him,\\nand yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved\\nHarry’s life.\\n“It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker\\nthan usual due to his near-strangulation.\\n“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused. “Y-you cast that doe?”\\n“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!”\\n“My Patronus is a stag.”\\n“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.”\\nHarry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater,\\nstooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron again.\\n“How come you’re here?”\\nApparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all.\\n“Well, I’ve – you know – I’ve come back. If –” He cleared his throat.\\n“You know. You still want me.”\\nThere was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure seemed to\\nrise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had\\njust saved Harry’s life.\\nRon looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see\\nthe things he was holding.\\n“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword\\nfor Harry’s inspection. “That’s why you jumped in, right?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get here? How\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n325\\ndid you find us?”\\n“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s a big\\nforest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a tree and wait\\nfor morning when I saw that deer coming and you following.”\\n“You didn’t see anyone else?”\\n“No,” said Ron. “I –”\\nBut he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards\\naway.\\n“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the\\npool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t\\ngoing to make a detour to – hey!”\\nHarry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two oaks\\ngrew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks\\nat eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the\\nroots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints.\\nHe walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the\\nHorcrux.\\n“Anything there?” Ron asked. “No,” said Harry.\\n“So how did the sword get in that pool?”\\n“Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.”\\nThey both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little\\nin the light from Hermione’s wand.\\n“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron. “One way to find out, isn’t\\nthere?” said Harry.\\nThe Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket was twitch-\\ning slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had\\nsensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let\\nhim possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the\\nmoment to destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding\\nHermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the sha-\\ndow of a sycamore tree.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n326\\n“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s\\nsurface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword,\\nhowever, Harry shook his head.\\n“No, you should do it.”\\n“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”\\n“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to be\\nyou.”\\nHe was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the\\ndoe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword.\\nDumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of\\nmagic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.\\n“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway, okay?\\nBecause whatever’s in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the\\ndiary tried to kill me.”\\n“How are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terrified.\\n“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry. The answer\\ncame so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always known it deep\\ndown: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him\\nrealize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones:\\nIt was easy to visualize it as a minuscule snake, curled upon the cold rock.\\n“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!”\\n“Why not?” asked Harry. “Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been\\nmonths –”\\n“I can’t, Harry, I’m serious – you do it –”\\n“But why?”\\n“Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away from the\\nlocket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! I’m not making excuses, Harry, for\\nwhat I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione,\\nit made me think stuff – stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything\\nworse, I can’t explain it, and then I’d take it off and I’d get my head on\\nstraight again, and then I’d have to put the effing thing back on – I can’t do\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n327\\nit, Harry!”\\nHe had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head.\\n“You can do it,” said Harry, “you can! You’ve just got the sword, I know\\nit’s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it, Ron.”\\nThe sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed,\\nthen, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the\\nrock.\\n“Tell me when,” he croaked.\\n“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing\\nhis eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the\\ncontents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been\\neasy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry’s neck still burned.\\n“One... two... three... open.”\\nThe last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket\\nswung wide with a little click.\\nBehind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and\\nhandsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and\\nslit-pupiled.\\n“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.\\nRon raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the\\nfrantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing\\nhimself, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.\\nThen a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux.\\n“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”\\n“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!”\\n“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.\\nAll you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible…”\\n“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the\\nsword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s eyes.\\n“Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter Least loved,\\nnow, by the girl who prefers your friend... Second best, always, eternally\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n328\\novershadowed…”\\n“Ron, stab it now!” Harry bellowed: He could feel the locket quivering\\nin his grip and was scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still\\nhigher, and as he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet.\\nOut of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like two\\ngrotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted.\\nRon yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the\\nlocket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side\\nby side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry,\\nwho had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned, suddenly,\\nwhite-hot.\\n“Ron!” he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Volde-\\nmort’s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face.\\n“Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of\\nyour absence... We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your pre-\\nsumption –”\\n“Presumption!” echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful\\nand yet more terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before\\nRon, who looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly at\\nhis side.\\n“Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry\\nPotter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What\\nare you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?”\\n“Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move: His eyes\\nwere wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected\\nin them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their voices\\nlifted in an evil duet.\\n“Your mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione\\njeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to\\nexchange...”\\n“Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are noth-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n329\\ning, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched\\nlike a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a\\nclose embrace: Their lips met.\\nOn the ground in front of them, Ron’s face filled with anguish. He raised\\nthe sword high, his arms shaking.\\n“Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled.\\nRon looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in\\nhis eyes.\\n“Ron –?”\\nThe sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there\\nwas a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around,\\nslipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend himself: but there was\\nnothing to fight.\\nThe monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: There was\\nonly Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking\\ndown at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.\\nSlowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do.\\nRon was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their\\nnormal blue; they were also wet.\\nHarry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken\\nHorcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were\\ngone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The\\nthing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its\\nfinal act.\\nThe sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head\\nin his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry\\ncrammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and\\nplaced a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron\\ndid not throw it off.\\n“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s\\nface was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n330\\nwant me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to\\neach other. With you gone...”\\nHe could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry\\nfully realized how much his absence had cost them.\\n“She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I reckon\\nshe feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I thought you\\nknew.” Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped\\nhis nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to\\nwhere Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had run\\ntoward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own\\nback and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approa-\\nched, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.\\n“I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I know I was a –\\na–”\\nHe looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would\\nswoop down upon him and claim him.\\n“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting the sword.\\nFinishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.”\\n“That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled.\\n“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said Harry. “I’ve\\nbeen trying to tell you that for years.”\\nSimultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the\\nstillsopping back of Ron’s jacket.\\n“And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve got to do is find\\nthe tent again.”\\nBut it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the\\ndoe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey back seemed to\\ntake a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and\\nit was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, Ron lagging a\\nlittle behind him.\\nIt was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n331\\nthe bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was\\nfast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had\\nsaid her name several times.\\n“Hermione!”\\nShe stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. “What’s\\nwrong? Harry? Are you all right?”\\n“It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s someone\\nhere.”\\n“What do you mean? Who –?”\\nShe saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the\\nthreadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s\\nrucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.\\nHermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron,\\nher eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips\\nslightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile and half\\nraised his arms.\\nHermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of\\nhim that she could reach.\\n“Ouch – ow – gerroff! What the –? Hermione – OW!”\\n“You – complete – arse – Ronald – Weasley!”\\nShe punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his\\nhead as Hermione advanced.\\n“You – crawl – back – here – after – weeks – and – weeks – oh, where’s\\nmy wand?”\\nShe looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and he\\nreacted instinctively.\\n“Protego!”\\nThe invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: The force of it\\nknocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she\\nleapt up again.\\n“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n332\\n“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose\\ncontrol like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my wand! Give\\nit back to me!”\\n“Hermione, will you please –”\\n“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched. “Don’t you\\ndare! Give it back now! And YOU!”\\nShe was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and\\nHarry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps.\\n“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!”\\n“I know,” Ron said, “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really –”\\n“Oh, you’re sorry!”\\nShe laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry\\nfor help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness.\\n“You come back after weeks – weeks – and you think it’s all going to be\\nall right if you just say sorry?”\\n“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron\\nwas fighting back.\\n“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. “Rack your\\nbrains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds –”\\n“Hermione,” interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, “he just\\nsaved my –”\\n“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and\\nweeks, we could have been dead for all he knew –”\\n“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the\\nfirst time, and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm\\nbetween them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re look-\\ning for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear\\nstraight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like –”\\n“What it’s been like for you?”\\nHer voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but\\nshe had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speech-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n333\\nless, and Ron seized his opportunity.\\n“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I walked straight\\ninto a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t go anywhere!”\\n“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a\\nchair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she\\nwould unravel them for several years.\\n“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re everywhere – gangs trying to earn gold\\nby rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there’s a reward from the\\nMinistry for everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like I might be\\nschool age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding.\\nI had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry.”\\n“What did you say to them?”\\n“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.”\\n“And they believed that?”\\n“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the\\nsmell off him…”\\nRon glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small\\ninstance of humor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly\\nknotted limbs.\\n“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit\\npathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me\\nand they’d taken my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while the\\nothers were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach,\\ngrabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I\\ndidn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again” – Ron held up his right hand\\nto show two missing fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly –\\n“and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that\\nbit of riverbank where we’d been you’d gone.”\\n“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice she\\nadopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been simply terrified.\\nMeanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think, what happened\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n334\\nthere, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake turned up, it nearly killed\\nboth of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by\\nabout a second.”\\n“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him.\\n“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into\\nperspective, doesn’t it?”\\n“Hermione,” said Harry quietly, “Ron just saved my life.” She appeared\\nnot to have heard him.\\n“One thing I would like to know, though,” she said, fixing her eyes on a\\nspot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find us tonight? That’s\\nimportant. Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by\\nanyone else we don’t want to see.”\\nRon glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket.\\n“This.”\\nShe had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.\\n“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and\\nfierce.\\n“It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said Ron. “I don’t know how\\nit works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I’ve been\\nwanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really\\nearly on Christmas morning and I heard... I heard you.”\\nHe was looking at Hermione.\\n“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously.\\n“No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he held up the\\nDeluminator again, “came out of this.”\\n“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone somewhere\\nbetween skepticism and curiosity.\\n“My name. ‘Ron.’ And you said... something about a wand “\\nHermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: It had been\\nthe first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the\\nday he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n335\\nHarry’s wand.\\n“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and it didn’t\\nseem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. And\\nthe light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the\\nwindow.”\\nRon raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused\\non something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.\\n“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get\\naround a Portkey, you know?”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically.\\n“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I\\nput on my rucksack and went out into the garden.\\n“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I\\ncame out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it\\nwell, it went inside me.”\\n“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly.\\n“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement with\\nhis free index finger, “right to my chest, and then – it just went straight\\nthrough. It was here,” he touched a point close to his heart, “I could feel it,\\nit was hot.\\nAnd once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it\\nwould take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the\\nside of a hill. There was snow everywhere…”\\n“We were there,” said Harry. “We spent two nights there, and the second\\nnight I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and\\ncalling out!”\\n“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective spells\\nwork, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you. I was\\nsure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and\\nwaited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show yourselves\\nwhen you packed up the tent.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n336\\n“No, actually,” said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under the\\nInvisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because,\\nas Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.”\\n“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d\\nappear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I\\nclicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me,\\nand I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you,\\nso I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end – and\\nHarry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.”\\n“You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply.\\nThey explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and\\nthe sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of\\nthem, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together.\\n“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you see who was\\ncasting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t\\nbelieve this! Then what happened?”\\nRon explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had\\nwaited for him to resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong,\\ndived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as far as the\\nopening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in.\\n“– and Ron stabbed it with the sword.”\\n“And and it went? Just like that?” she whispered.\\n“Well, it – it screamed,” said Harry with half a glance at Ron. “Here.”\\nHe threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined\\nits punctured windows.\\nDeciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm\\nwith a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron.\\n“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?”\\n“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the\\nlocket. “Oh – oh yeah.”\\nHe tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n337\\nout of its pocket. “Here. I figured it’s always handy to have a backup.”\\n“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “Mine’s broken.”\\n“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet,\\nand he looked apprehensive again.\\nHermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed\\nback into her bed and settled down without another word.\\nRon passed Harry the new wand.\\n“About the best you could hope for, I think,” murmured Harry.\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember those birds she set\\non me?”\\n“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled voice from be-\\nneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his\\nmaroon pajamas out of his rucksack.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n338\\nCHAPTER TWENTY\\nXENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD\\nH\\narry had not expected Hermione’s anger to abate overnight, and was\\ntherefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and\\npointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an unna-\\nturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing\\nremorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the\\nonly non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments\\nhe spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the\\nundergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery. “Someone\\nhelped us,” he kept saying. “Someone sent that doe. Someone’s on our side.\\nOne Horcrux down, mate!”\\nBolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possi-\\nble locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed\\nthe matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more break-\\nthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his\\nbuoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the\\nmysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s\\nreturn, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight\\nface.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n339\\nLate in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s baleful presence\\nagain, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent\\nblackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had\\nfinally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione’s various\\nwanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric’s\\nHollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered\\nabout the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away.\\n“... and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after\\nexplaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the\\nMinistry.\\n“The what?”\\n“You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who’s name!”\\n“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said Harry.\\n“But I haven’t got a problem calling him V –”\\n“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione\\n(nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. “Sorry,”\\nsaid Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, “but the name’s been\\njinxed, Harry, that’s how they track people! Using his name breaks\\nprotective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance – it’s\\nhow they found us in Tottenham Court Road!”\\n“Because we used his name?”\\n“Exactly! You’ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only\\npeople who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who\\never dared use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is\\ntrackable – quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got\\nKingsley –”\\n“You’re kidding?”\\n“Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his\\nway out. He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thought-\\nfully with the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent\\nthat doe?”\\x0cJ.K.

I mean,” Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes,\\n“he had the real sword last, didn’t he?”\\nHarry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing\\nbehind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back\\nto them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly\\ncomforting. He shook his head.\\n“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He’s\\ndefinitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.”\\n“Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said Ron. “Tonks’s chang-\\ned, didn’t it?”\\n“Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show himself?\\nWhy wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?”\\n“Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it to you while he\\nwas alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of\\nkids’ stories?”\\n“Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, des-\\nperate for the answer.\\n“I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit\\nhacked off, he was having a laugh or – or he just wanted to make it more\\ndifficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing\\nwhen he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He – well,” Ron’s ears turned\\nbright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he\\nprodded with his toe, “he must’ve known I’d run out on you.”\\n“No,” Harry corrected him. “He must’ve known you’d always want to\\ncome back.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n341\\nRon looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject,\\nHarry said, “Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote\\nabout him?”\\n“Oh yeah,” said Ron at once, “people are talking about it quite a lot.\\n‘Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news, Dumbledore being pals\\nwith Grindelwald, but now it’s just something to laugh about for people who\\ndidn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who\\nthought he was such a good bloke. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal,\\nthough. He was really young when they –”\\n“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something\\nin his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.\\nA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry\\ntook aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which\\nHermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made\\nof blackthorn.\\n“Engorgio.”\\nThe spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried\\nagain. This time the spider grew slightly larger.\\n“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young,\\nokay?”\\nHarry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders. “Sorry – Reducio.”\\nThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand.\\nEvery minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less power-\\nful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt\\nintrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else’s hand sewn to the end of\\nhis arm.\\n“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached them\\nnoiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to\\nenlarge and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of confidence, Harry.”\\nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about break-\\ning his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n342\\ntake the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would\\nhave hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed;\\nbut when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished\\nbehind her book once more.\\nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took\\nfirst watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand\\nlevitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less\\npowerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading,\\nwhile Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden\\nwireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.\\n“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that tells the\\nnews like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s side and are\\nfollowing the Ministry line, but this one... you wait till you hear it, it’s great.\\nOnly they can’t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in\\ncase they’re raided, and you need a password to tune in... Trouble is, I\\nmissed the last one “\\nHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, muttering\\nrandom words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances,\\nplainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he\\nmight not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered,\\nHermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice\\nwith the blackthorn wand.\\nFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping\\nat once.\\n“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously. Hermione\\ndid not deign to respond, but approached Harry. “We need to talk,” she said.\\nHe looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies\\nof Albus Dumbledore.\\n“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was\\na chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s version\\nof his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione’s answer, however, was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n343\\ncompletely unexpected.\\n“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.” He stared at her.\\n“Sorry?”\\n“Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him!”\\n“Er – why?”\\nShe took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, “It’s that\\nmark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!”\\nShe thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s unwell-\\ning eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had\\nwritten Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s familiar thin, slanting handwrit-\\ning. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written tho-\\nse words, that they had not been Rita’s invention.\\n“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!”\\nHe obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but,\\nlooking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore\\nhad replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark\\ninscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\\n“Er – what are you –?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him\\nwith a look and turned back to Harry.\\n“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said it was\\nGrindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s\\nHollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came\\nalong! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what\\nit means – I don’t even know whether Grindelwald’s still alive – but we can\\nask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure\\nthis is important, Harry!”\\nHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face\\nand then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he\\nsaid, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. We talked our-\\nselves into going there, and –”\\n“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n344\\nthe Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to find out about the sign?”\\n“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exasperated. “We keep trying to\\nconvince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues –”\\n“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up Ron. “I think\\nHermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.”\\nHarry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s support of\\nHermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular\\nrune.\\n“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your\\nside, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone\\nthey’ve got to help you!”\\n“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.\\n“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it\\nbefore he died?”\\n“Maybe... maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said\\nHermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.\\n“Yeah,” said Ron sycophantically, “that makes sense.”\\n“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought to talk to\\nMr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and God-\\nric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!”\\n“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of going to see\\nLovegood –”\\nHis hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered suspi-\\nciously as she raised her own.\\n“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.\\n“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once we’ve seen\\nLovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do\\nthe Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?”\\n“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron. “I dunno exactly where,\\nbut Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention\\nthem. Shouldn’t be hard to find.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n345\\nWhen Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. “You\\nonly agreed to try and get back in her good books.”\\n“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of both.\\nCheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!”\\nThey had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchpole from\\nthe breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their\\nhigh vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the\\ngreat slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between\\nclouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their\\nhands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high\\nhedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house\\nprotection from Muggle eyes.\\n“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron.\\n“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christ-\\nmas,” said Hermione coldly.\\n“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with an incredulous laugh. “Do you\\nthink I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you?\\nYeah, Fred and George would’ve been great about it. And Ginny, she’d\\nhave been really understanding.”\\n“But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised.\\n“Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been decent to\\nme. He – he wasn’t impressed when he heard what I’d done, but he didn’t\\ngo on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family\\nknow I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren’t going home for\\nChristmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday\\nafter they were married. I don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much\\nshe hates Celestina Warbeck.”\\nRon turned his back on the Burrow.\\n“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.\\nThey walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione’s insistence, hidden\\nbeneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be unin-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n346\\nhabited apart from one small cottage, which seemed deserted.\\n“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said\\nHermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with gera-\\nniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.\\n“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if you\\nlooked through the Lovegoods’ window. Let’s try the next lot of hills.”\\nSo they Disapparated a few miles farther north.\\n“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was\\npointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared,\\nwhere a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great\\nblack cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky.\\n“That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It\\nlooks like a giant rook!”\\n“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower. “I was\\ntalking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.”\\nRon’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When\\nHarry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in\\ntheir sides, they found him grinning broadly.\\n“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.”\\nThree hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate.\\nThe first read,\\nTHE QUIBBLER. EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD\\nthe second,\\nPICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE\\nthe third,\\nKEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS\\nThe gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the\\nfront door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush\\ncovered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n347\\nHarry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a\\nwide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves\\nbut still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded\\nmistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a\\nslightly flattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of the\\nbranches.\\n“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” said Hermione. “It’s\\nyou Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.”\\nHe did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag.\\nShe then rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded\\nwith iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle.\\nBarely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood\\nXenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained\\nnightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xeno-\\nphilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur’s wedding by compa-\\nrison.\\n“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried in a high-\\npitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally\\nat Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O.\\n“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m Harry,\\nHarry Potter.”\\nXenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was not\\npointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s something we’d\\nlike to ask you.”\\n“I... I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed\\nand cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a shock... My word... I...\\nI’m afraid I don’t really think I ought to –”\\n“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-\\nthanwarm welcome.\\n“I – oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n348\\nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door\\nshut behind them. They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry\\nhad ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being\\ninside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls – the stove,\\nthe sink, and the cupboards – and all of it had been painted with flowers,\\ninsects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized\\nLuna’s style: The effect, in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelm-\\ning.\\nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper\\nlevels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from over-\\nhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.\\n“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely un-\\ncomfortable, and he led the way.\\nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and work-\\nplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much\\nsmaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of\\nRequirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into\\na gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were\\npiles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made\\nmodels of creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping\\njaws, hung from the ceiling.\\nLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wood-\\nen object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the\\nbizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment\\nHarry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact\\nthat it was churning out Quibblers.\\n“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized\\na grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers,\\nwhich all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat\\nmuffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.\\n“Why have you come here?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n349\\nBefore Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of\\nshock. “Mr. Lovegood – what’s that?”\\nShe was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a\\nunicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into\\nthe room.\\n“It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius. “No it\\nisn’t!” said Hermione.\\n“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the moment –”\\n“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and\\nit’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!”\\n“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging away from\\nthe horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.\\n“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr.\\nLovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can\\nexplode at the slightest touch?”\\n“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly, a\\nmulish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature, and its\\nhorn –”\\n“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s\\nan Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous – I don’t know where you\\ngot it –”\\n“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a\\ndelightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack.\\nA Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to Harry, “why\\nexactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?”\\n“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again.\\n“Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.”\\nHis good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seemed simultaneously\\nterrified and mesmerized.\\n“Yes. The thing is... helping Harry Potter... rather dangerous...”\\n“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n350\\nHarry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?”\\nXenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still\\nbanging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.\\n“Er – yes, I have expressed that view. However –”\\n“That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” said Ron.\\nXenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting\\nbetween the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing\\nsome painful internal struggle.\\n“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione. “Let’s see what she thinks.”\\nXenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in\\na shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, “Luna is\\ndown at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She... she will like to\\nsee you. I’ll go and call her and then – yes, very well. I shall try to help\\nyou.”\\nHe disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door\\nopen and close. They looked at each other.\\n“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ten times his guts.”\\n“He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters\\nfind out I was here,” said Harry.\\n“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite, telling\\neveryone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for\\nheaven’s sake keep away from that horn.”\\nHarry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a\\nstream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill.\\nThey were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the\\ndirection of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny\\nwas over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they\\nhad been since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was\\ngazing toward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of\\nit; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius’s attitude\\nproved that.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n351\\nHe turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar\\nobject standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a\\nbeautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking head-\\ndress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the\\nsides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that\\nran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck\\nto a second strap around her forehead.\\n“Look at this,” said Harry.\\n“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.”\\nThey heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had\\nclimbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased\\nin Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming\\nteapot.\\n“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the tray into\\nHermione’s arms and joining Harry at the statue’s side. “Modeled, fittingly\\nenough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. ‘Wit beyond\\nmeasure is man’s greatest treasure!’”\\nHe indicated the objects like ear trumpets.\\n“These are the Wrackspurt siphons – to remove all sources of distraction\\nfrom the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed out the tiny wings, “a\\nbillywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,” he pointed\\nto the orange radish, “the Dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to\\naccept the extraordinary.”\\nXenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to\\nbalance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.\\n“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophilius. “We\\nmake it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply\\npurple as beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge,\\nshe is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, she has\\ncaught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and\\nhelp yourselves to sugar.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n352\\n“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat\\ndown, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?”\\n“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly,\\n“it’s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and\\nFleur’s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.”\\nXenophilius raised his eyebrows.\\n“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n353\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\\nTHE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS\\nH\\narry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to\\nhave understood what Xenophilius had said either.\\n“The Deathly Hallows?”\\n“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them? I’m not\\nsurprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckleheaded\\nyoung man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who attacked\\nme for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance.\\nThere is nothing Dark about the Hallows – at least, not in that crude sense.\\nOne simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope\\nthat they might help one with the Quest.”\\nHe stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank\\nsome.\\n“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really understand.”\\nTo be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff\\nwas quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored\\nEvery Flavor Beans.\\n“Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius,\\nsmacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n354\\n“But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione. Xenophilius set\\naside his empty teacup.\\n“I assume that you are all familiar with ‘The Tale of the Three Bro-\\nthers’?”\\nHarry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione both said, “Yes.” Xenophilius\\nnodded gravely.\\n“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of the Three\\nBrothers’... I have a copy somewhere…”\\nHe glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and\\nbooks, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right\\nhere.”\\nAnd she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded\\nbag.\\n“The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he\\nsaid, “Well then, why don’t you read it aloud? Much the best way to make\\nsure we all understand.”\\n“Er... all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and\\nHarry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the\\npage as she gave a little cough, and began to read.\\n“‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely,\\nwinding road at twilight –’”\\n“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had stretched out,\\narms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.\\n“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said Ron.\\n“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said Harry\\nbefore he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much\\nattention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. “Go on, Hermione.”\\n“‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too\\ndangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the\\nmagical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge\\nappear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n355\\nfound their path blocked by a hooded figure.\\n“‘And Death spoke to them –’”\\n“Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?”\\n“It’s a fairy tale, Harry!”\\n“Right, sorry. Go on.”\\n“’And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out\\nof three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death\\nwas cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their\\nmagic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough\\nto evade him.’”\\n“’So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more\\npowerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its\\nowner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death\\ncrossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a\\nbranch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother.’”\\n“’Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he\\nwanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall\\nothers from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave\\nit to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power\\nto bring back the dead.’”\\n“’And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would\\nlike. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the bro-\\nthers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would\\nenable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death.\\nAnd Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.’”\\n“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted again.\\n“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. “Sometimes he gets bored of\\nrunning at them, flapping his arms and shrieking... sorry, Hermione.”\\n“’Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on\\ntheir way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had\\nhad, and admiring Death’s gifts.’”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n356\\n“’In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.’”\\n“’The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant\\nvillage, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally,\\nwith the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that\\nfollowed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother\\nproceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had\\nsnatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.’”\\n“’That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay,\\nwine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure,\\nslit the oldest brother’s throat.’”\\n“’And so Death took the first brother for his own.’”\\n“’Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he\\nlived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead,\\nand turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure\\nof the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared\\nat once before him.’”\\n“’Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she\\nhad returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered.\\nFinally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself\\nso as truly to join her.’”\\n“’And so Death took the second brother for his own.’”\\n“’But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was\\nnever able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the\\nyoungest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his\\nson. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly,\\nand, equals, they departed this life.’”\\nHermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius\\nseemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze\\nfrom the window and said, “Well, there you are.”\\n“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused. “Those are the Deathly\\nHallows,” said Xenophilius.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n357\\nHe picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn\\npiece of parchment from between more books.\\n“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the\\nparchment. “The Resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added a circle on top\\nof the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he finished, enclosing both line and\\ncircle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione.\\n“Together,” he said, “the Deathly Hallows.”\\n“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows’ in the story,”\\nsaid Hermione.\\n“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That is a\\nchildren’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who under-\\nstand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three\\nobjects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of\\nDeath.”\\nThere was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the win-\\ndow.\\nAlready the sun was low in the sky.\\n“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly. “When you\\nsay ‘master of Death’ –” said Ron.\\n“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror. Vanqui-\\nsher. Whichever term you prefer.”\\n“But then... do you mean...” said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell\\nthat she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that\\nyou believe these objects – these Hallows – actually exist?” Xenophilius\\nraised his eyebrows again.\\n“Well, of course.”\\n“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack,\\n“Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe –?”\\n“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius. “You\\nare, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-\\nminded.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n358\\n“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron, nodding\\ntoward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not\\nlaughing.\\n“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again. “We all know that there are\\nsuch things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But –”\\n“Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger!\\nI mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment\\nCharm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair,\\nwhich will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque.\\nWe are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer comp-\\nletely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable\\nconcealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have\\nyou ever seen like that, Miss Granger?”\\nHermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more\\nconfused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry\\nknew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak\\nexactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with\\nthem at that very moment.\\n“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned\\nargument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would\\nbe immeasurably rich, would he not?”\\nHe glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the\\nfaintest trace of pink.\\n“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the Cloak existed... what\\nabout the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?”\\n“What of it?”\\n“Well, how can that be real?”\\n“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius. Hermione looked outraged.\\n“But that’s – I’m sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous! How can I\\npossibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold of – of all the\\npebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything’s\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n359\\nreal if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t\\nexist!”\\n“Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see that you are\\nopening your mind a little.”\\n“So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort,\\n“you think that exists too?”\\n“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius. “The\\nElder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in\\nwhich it passes from hand to hand.”\\n“Which is what?” asked Harry.\\n“Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous\\nowner, if he is to be truly master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have\\nheard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter\\nof Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son,\\nHereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the\\nwand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the\\nElder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.”\\nHarry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she\\ndid not contradict him.\\n“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.\\n“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window.\\n“Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with\\nArcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and\\nwhich took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them?\\nHistory, alas, does not tell us.”\\nThere was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, “Mr. Lovegood, does\\nthe Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?”\\nXenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s memory,\\nbut he could not locate it. Peverell... he had heard that name before...\\n“But you have been misleading me, young woman!” said Xenophilius,\\nnow sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. “I\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n360\\nthought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe\\nthat the Peverells have everything – everything! – to do with the Hallows!”\\n“Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron.\\n“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Holl-\\now,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. “Ignotus Peverell.”\\n“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. “The sign\\nof the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive proof!”\\n“Of what?” asked Ron.\\n“Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell\\nbrothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners\\nof the Hallows!”\\nWith another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray,\\nand headed for the spiral staircase.\\n“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs again.\\n“Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.”\\n“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,” said Ron\\nunder his breath.\\nHarry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the\\nkitchen downstairs before speaking.\\n“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.\\n“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be\\nwhat the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a\\nwaste of time.”\\n“I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,”\\nsaid Ron.\\n“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.\\n“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them\\nlessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go\\nmessing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down,\\nmind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron\\nadded, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n361\\n“What are you talking about?”\\n“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry\\nMuggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never\\nprosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.”\\n“Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione reminded him. “We\\nwere taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a rather pungent\\nsmell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasper-\\nation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she\\nwas annoyed at Ron. “I think you’re right,” she told him. “It’s just a morality\\ntale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose –”\\nThe three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the Cloak,”\\nRon said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.”\\nThey looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.\\n“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you\\nwouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand,\\nHermione, come on!”\\n“We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.\\n“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!” said Her-\\nmione. “Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble –”\\n“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if you were prat\\nenough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve\\ngot an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you’re hard\\nenough.’ As long as you kept your trap shut –”\\n“Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, looking\\nskeptical. “You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have\\nbeen stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.”\\n“There have?” asked Harry.\\nHermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly fami-\\nliar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.\\n“The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different\\nnames through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n362\\nwho’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but\\n– oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use\\nthem. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than\\nother people’s.”\\n“But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those wands – the Deathstick\\nand the Wand of Destiny – aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the cen-\\nturies under different names?”\\n“What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?” said Ron.\\nHarry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all,\\nridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and\\nit had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort\\nhad pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could\\nit have been broken?\\n“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him.\\n“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius... Mad-Eye...\\nDumbledore... my parents…”\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione smiled.\\n“But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come back,\\nwould they?” said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. “I don’t\\nsuppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise\\nthe dead, have there?” he asked Hermione.\\n“No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood\\ncould kid themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from\\nthe Sorcerer’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a\\nstone to reverse death.”\\nThe smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like\\nburning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat\\nenough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.\\n“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you realize,\\nhe’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never\\nstopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s infallible. We’ve\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n363\\nnever been spotted under it –”\\n“Of course not – we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!”\\n“But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they’re not exactly ten a\\nKnut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard\\nstuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being\\nripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in. Harry’s was owned by his\\ndad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s just perfect!”\\n“Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone “\\nAs they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half\\nlistening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next\\nlevel and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from\\nthe ceiling of the room above.\\nAfter a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but\\na painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs.\\n“Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look around when\\nhe’s not here!”\\nBut Harry had already reached the next level.\\nLuna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted\\nfaces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as\\nthe portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them\\nall the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden\\nchains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining\\nthem for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one\\nword, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends... friends... friends...\\nHarry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room.\\nThere was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman\\nwho looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-\\ngroomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was\\ndusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around.\\nSomething was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust.\\nThere were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n364\\na cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single\\ncobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a bloodred sky.\\n“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but\\nbefore he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the\\nkitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.\\n“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?”\\n“Excuse me?”\\n“Where’s Luna?”\\nXenophilius halted on the top step.\\n“I – I’ve already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for\\nPlimpies.”\\n“So why have you only laid that tray for four?”\\nXenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was\\nthe continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray\\nas Xenophilius’s hands shook.\\n“I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks,” said Harry. “Her clothes are\\ngone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep\\nlooking out of the window?”\\nXenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to\\nenter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and\\nnumerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the\\ntablecloth; the press fell silent at last.\\nHermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand\\nstill pointing at Mr. Lovegood.\\n“Harry, look at this.”\\nHe strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The\\nfront of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words\\nUNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE and captioned with the reward money.\\n“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked coldly, his\\nmind working very fast. “Is that what you were doing when you went into\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n365\\nthe garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?”\\nXenophilius licked his lips.\\n“They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what I’ve been writing.\\nThey took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what they’ve done to\\nher. But they might give her back to me if I – if I –”\\n“Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him.\\n“No deal,” said Ron flatly. “Get out of the way, we’re leaving.”\\nXenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a\\ndreadful leer.\\n“They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna.\\nYou must not leave.”\\nHe spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision\\nof his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib.\\n“Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the way, Mr. Love-\\ngood.”\\n“HARRY!” Hermione screamed.\\nFigures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of\\nthem looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized\\ntheir mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and\\nHermione out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across\\nthe room and hit the Erumpent horn.\\nThere was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room\\napart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along\\nwith an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air,\\nthen crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms\\nover his head. He heard Hermione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a series of\\nsickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted\\noff his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.\\nHalf buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely\\nbreathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of\\nLuna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n366\\nlay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were\\nfloating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side,\\nblocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape\\nmoved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed\\nher finger to her lips.\\nThe door downstairs crashed open.\\n“Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?” said a rough\\nvoice. “Didn’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?”\\nThere was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. “No... no...\\nupstairs... Potter!”\\n“I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming back for anything\\nless than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted\\nto swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week\\nbefore” – another bang, another squeal – “when you thought we’d give her\\nback if you offered us proof there are Crumple” – bang – “Headed” – bang\\n– “Snorkacks?”\\n“No – no – I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really is Potter! Really!”\\n“And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!”\\nroared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with\\nsqueals of agony from Xenophilius.\\n“The place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool second\\nvoice, echoing up the mangled staircase. “The stairs are completely block-\\ned. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place down.”\\n“You lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named Selwyn. “You’ve\\nnever seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you’d lure us here to kill\\nus, did you? And you think you’ll get your girl back like this?”\\n“I swear... I swear... Potter’s upstairs!”\\n“Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs.\\nHarry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something\\nwas swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow.\\n“There’s someone up there all right, Selwyn,” said the second man sha-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n367\\nrply. “It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius. “Please...\\nplease... give me Luna, just let me have Luna…”\\n“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you get up\\nthose stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it’s a\\ntrick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll see\\nif we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.”\\nXenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and\\nscrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs.\\n“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.”\\nHe started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was\\nmaking on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione\\nclimbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay,\\ntrying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius’s\\nbanging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free\\nRon with the use of a Hover Charm.\\n“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the\\ntop of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them.\\nShe was still white with dust. “Do you trust me, Harry?”\\nHarry nodded.\\n“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron,\\nyou’re going to put it on.”\\n“Me? But Harry –”\\n“Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.”\\nHarry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The\\nprinting press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to\\nshift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was\\nwaiting for.\\n“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight... any second…”\\nXenophilius’s paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard.\\n“Obliviate!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his face, then\\nat the floor beneath them. “Deprimo!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n368\\nShe had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders,\\nHarry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from\\nbelow, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast\\nquantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the\\nshattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the\\ncollapsing house rang in Harry’s ears as she dragged him once more into\\ndarkness.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n369\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\\nTHE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\nH\\narry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed\\nto have landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already runn-\\ning in a circle around them, waving her wand.\\n“Protego Totalum... Salvio Hexia...”\\n“That treacherous old bleeder!” Ron panted, emerging from beneath the\\nInvisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. “Hermione, you’re a genius, a\\ntotal genius, I can’t believe we got out of that!”\\n“Cave Inimicum... Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn’t I tell him?\\nAnd now his house has been blown apart!”\\n“Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his\\nlegs. “What d’you reckon they’ll do to him?”\\n“Oh, I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione. “That’s why I want-\\ned the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew\\nXenophilius hadn’t been lying!”\\n“Why hide me, though?” asked Ron.\\n“You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! They’ve kidnapped\\nLuna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your\\nfamily if they knew you’re with him?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n370\\n“But what about your mum and dad?”\\n“They’re in Australia,” said Hermione. “They should be all right. They\\ndon’t know anything.”\\n“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed.\\n“Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t know what\\nwe’d do without you.”\\nShe beamed, but became solemn at once. “What about Luna?”\\n“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive –” began Ron.\\n“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be alive, she\\nmust!”\\n“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she survives\\nthe place, though... Loads don’t…”\\n“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative.\\n“She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teach-\\ning all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.”\\n“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes.\\n“I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if –”\\n“– if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,” said Ron.\\nThey put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea.\\nAfter their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe,\\nfamiliar, and friendly.\\n“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silen-\\nce. “Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a comp-\\nlete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows... such rubbish although actually,”\\na sudden thought seemed to have struck her, “he might have made it all up,\\nmightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he\\njust wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!”\\n“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up\\nwhen you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatch-\\ners caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a\\nbit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n371\\nloads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the\\ntruth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.”\\n“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if he was\\nbeing honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.”\\n“Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to\\nbe a myth, wasn’t it?”\\n“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!”\\n“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron. “Harry’s Invi-\\nsibility Cloak –”\\n“‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione firmly. “A\\nstory about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple\\nas hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need\\nalready!”\\n“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said Harry, turn-\\ning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.\\n“There’s no such thing, Harry!”\\n“You said there have been loads of wands – the Deathstick and whatever\\nthey were called –”\\n“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what\\nabout the Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched quotation marks\\naround the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise the\\ndead, and that’s that!”\\n“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum\\nand dad appear... and Cedric...”\\n“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said Hermione.\\n“Those kinds of – of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing\\nsomeone back to life.”\\n“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story\\nsays that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second\\nbrother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her\\nfor a while…”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n372\\nHe saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expre-\\nssion. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had\\nscared her with his talk of living with dead people.\\n“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said hast-\\nily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything about him,\\nthen?”\\n“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I looked\\nhim up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or\\ndone anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only\\nplace I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ is Nature’s Nobility: A Wiz-\\narding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,” she explained as Ron rais-\\ned his eyebrows. “It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the\\nmale line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to\\nvanish.”\\n“‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron.\\n“It means the name’s died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in the\\ncase of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they’d just\\nbe called something different.”\\nAnd then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had\\nstirred at the sound of the name “Peverell”: a filthy old man brandishing an\\nugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, “Marvolo\\nGaunt!”\\n“Sorry?” said Ron and Hermione together.\\n“Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With\\nDumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”\\nRon and Hermione looked bewildered.\\n“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had\\nthe Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the\\nMinistry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!”\\n“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you see\\nwhat it looked like?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n373\\n“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing fancy\\non there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it\\nreally close up after it had been cracked open.”\\nHarry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her\\neyes.\\nRon was looking from one to the other, astonished.\\n“Blimey... You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows?”\\n“Why not?”said Harry excitedly. “Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git\\nwho lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had\\nbeen passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it\\nreally was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the\\ntype to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on\\nthe stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having\\npure blood made you practically royal.”\\n“Yes... and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but\\nHarry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think –”\\n“Well, why not? Why not?” said Harry, abandoning caution. “It was a\\nstone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it was the Resu-\\nrrection Stone?”\\nRon’s mouth fell open.\\n“Blimey – but would it still work if Dumbledore broke –?”\\n“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resu-\\nrrection Stone!”\\nHermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. “Harry,\\nyou’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story –”\\n“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I\\nknow the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was\\ndescended from the Peverells!”\\n“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone pro-\\nperly!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n374\\n“Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did\\nDumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”\\nBut Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Her-\\nmione’s...\\nThree objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor\\nmaster of Death... Master... Conqueror... Vanquisher... The last enemy that\\nshall be destroyed is death...\\nAnd he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose\\nHorcruxes were no match... Neither can live while the other survives...\\nWas this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way, after\\nall, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of\\nthe Deathly Hallows, would he be safe?\\n“Harry?”\\nBut he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak\\nand was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as\\nair. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the\\nWizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described:\\nA cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and\\nendures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter\\nwhat spells are cast at it...\\nAnd then, with a gasp, he remembered –\\n“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!”\\nHis voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not\\ncare. “My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is\\nwhy! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow!\\nIgnotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow…” Harry was walking\\nblindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were\\nopening all around him. “He’s my ancestor! I’m descended from the third\\nbrother! It all makes sense!”\\nHe felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea\\nof possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turn-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n375\\ned back to the other two.\\n“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around\\nhis neck, his fingers shaking hard.\\n“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. “Read it!\\nDumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He\\ndidn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful\\nthat he made himself completely invisible without one!”\\nSomething fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had\\ndislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up,\\nand then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another\\ngift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out.\\n“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring – it’s in the Snitch!”\\n“You – you reckon?”\\nHe could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious,\\nso clear to Harry: Everything fit, everything... His Cloak was the third\\nHallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the\\nsecond, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder\\nWand, and then –\\nBut it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all\\nhis hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in\\nthe darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.\\n“That’s what he’s after.”\\nThe change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared.\\n“You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.”\\nHe turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was\\nthe truth. It all made sense. Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was\\nseeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance\\nof the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the\\nnight, thinking...\\nVoldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have\\ntold him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n376\\nHarry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows.\\nWas it likely that Voldemort knew about them?\\nHarry gazed into the darkness... If Voldemort had known about the\\nDeathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to\\npossess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he\\nhad known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes\\nin the first place. Didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and\\nturned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great\\nWizarding secret?\\nWhich meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its\\nfull power, without understanding that it was one of three... for the wand\\nwas the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known...\\nThe bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizard-\\ning history...\\nHarry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding\\nover the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his\\ndiscoveries.\\nHe turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione\\nstanding exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter,\\nRon at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how far they\\nhad traveled in the last few minutes?\\n“This is it,” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own\\nastonished certainty. “This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are\\nreal, and I’ve got one – maybe two –”\\nHe held up the Snitch.\\n“– and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize... he\\njust thinks it’s a powerful wand –”\\n“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back\\nLily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.”\\n“But don’t you see? It all fits –”\\n“No, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t, Harry, you’re just getting carried\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n377\\naway. Please,” she said as he started to speak, “please just answer me this:\\nIf the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them,\\nknew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of\\nDeath – Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?”\\nHe had his answer ready.\\n“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for your-\\nself! It’s a Quest!”\\n“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’!”\\ncried Hermione in exasperation. “I didn’t really believe it!”\\nHarry took no notice.\\n“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my\\nstrength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.”\\n“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and\\nDumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Hor-\\ncruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows,\\nwe can’t afford to get sidetracked –”\\nHarry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and\\nover in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection\\nStone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows\\nwere real.\\nShe appealed to Ron.\\n“You don’t believe in this, do you?” Harry looked up. Ron hesitated.\\n“I dunno... I mean... bits of it sort of fit together,” said Ron awkwardly.\\n“But when you look at the whole thing...” He took a deep breath. “I think\\nwe’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore\\ntold us to do. Maybe... maybe we should forget about this Hallows busi-\\nness.”\\n“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first watch.”\\nAnd she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance, bringing the\\naction to a fierce full stop.\\nBut Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n378\\ntaken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts\\nwhirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could\\njust possess them all...\\nI open at the close... But what was ‘the close’? Why couldn’t he have the\\nstone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these\\nquestions in person... and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the\\ndarkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would\\nnot open...\\nAnd the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was\\nVoldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him\\nVoldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort\\nwere united in wanting the very same thing Hermione would not like that\\nidea, of course... But then, she did not believe... Xenophilius had been right,\\nin a way... Limited. Narrow. Close-minded. The truth was that she was\\nscared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection\\nStone... and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly\\nswallowing it, but the cold metal did not yield...\\nIt was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azka-\\nban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He\\nhad forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If\\nonly they could rescue her; but dementors in those numbers would be\\nvirtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not yet tried\\ncasting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand... He must try that in the morn-\\ning...\\nIf only there was a way of getting a better wand...\\nAnd desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible,\\nswallowed him once more...\\nThey packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary\\nshower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched\\nthe tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden\\nlandscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n379\\nthe Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that\\nnothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could\\nextinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside\\nhim, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their\\ndetermined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his\\nspirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute.\\nHarry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that\\nhe felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Hor-\\ncruxes.\\n“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was\\ncareless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him\\noff for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. “We’re not the ones\\nwith an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore\\nwanted us to do!”\\nBut he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the\\nsign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry\\nremained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden\\nSnitch. Neither can live while the other survives... master of Death Why\\ndidn’t Ron and Hermione understand?\\n“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’” Harry quoted calmly.\\n“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?”\\nHermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.\\nEven the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on dis-\\ncussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting side-\\nshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun\\nto prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other\\ntwo. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by\\nwhat he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in\\nquality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in\\nand out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of\\nan object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n380\\nmore shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was\\ndisconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between\\nhimself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared\\nand, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected\\nthese unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it\\nwas the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Volde-\\nmort’s mind as well as before.\\nAs the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his\\nnew self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because\\nhe was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps\\nbecause Harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership\\nqualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two\\ninto action.\\n“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of action, come\\non! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage...”\\nDiagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania,\\nevery place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or\\nmurdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only\\nto stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in\\nsilence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the\\nElder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places\\nsimply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving.\\n“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley is a\\nWizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a\\npoke around.”\\nThese frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within\\noccasional sight of Snatchers.\\n“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,” said Ron.\\n“The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are\\nreally dangerous. They said on Potterwatch –”\\n“On what?” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n381\\n“Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I\\nkeep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s\\ngoing on! Nearly all the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all\\nexcept Potterwatch. I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in “\\nRon spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various\\nrhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they\\nwould catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox, and once a few\\nbars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.” While he tapped, Ron conti-\\nnued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random\\nwords under his breath.\\n“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them. “Bill\\nhad a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end…”\\nBut not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the\\ntent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that\\nhad forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly\\nfrom inside the tent.\\n“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry!” Rous-\\ned for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly\\nHallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione\\nkneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been\\npolishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting\\nopenmouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice\\nwas issuing.\\n“... apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was\\ndue to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.”\\n“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione. “I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool,\\neh?”\\n“... now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was saying, “and\\nI’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me\\nhere this evening. Evening, boys!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n382\\n“Hi.”\\n“Evening, River.”\\n“‘River,’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names, but\\nyou can usually tell –”\\n“Shh!” said Hermione.\\n“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s take\\na moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News\\nand Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great\\nregret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk\\nCresswell.”\\nHarry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at\\none another in horror.\\n“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that\\nMuggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been\\ntraveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is\\nlistening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents\\nand sisters are desperate for news.\\n“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead\\nin their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak,\\nbut members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing\\nCurse – more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slau-\\nghter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime.\\n“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda\\nBagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she\\ndied several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body\\nshowed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic.\\n“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in\\nmemory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the\\nunnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.”\\nSilence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry\\nyearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n383\\nwas the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long\\ntime.\\n“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we turn to regular contributor\\nRoyal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the\\nMuggle world.”\\n“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring.\\n“Kingsley!” burst out Ron.\\n“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him.\\n“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they conti-\\nnue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we continue to\\nhear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own\\nsafety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’\\nknowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example,\\nperhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your\\nstreet. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.”\\n“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in\\nthese dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’?” asked Lee.\\n“I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’\\nand then to ‘Death Eaters,’” replied Kingsley. “We’re all human, aren’t we?\\nEvery human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”\\n“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if\\never we get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our\\npopular feature ‘Pals of Potter.’”\\n“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron started to speak,\\nbut Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.\\n“We know it’s Lupin!”\\n“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on\\nour program, that Harry Potter is still alive?”\\n“I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that his\\ndeath would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it\\nhad happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n384\\nresisting the new regime. ‘The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of every-\\nthing for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of inno-\\ncence, the need to keep resisting.”\\nA mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven\\nhim, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met?\\n“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romu-\\nlus?”\\n“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesitated\\nslightly. “And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly\\nalways right.”\\nHarry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.\\n“Nearly always right,” she repeated.\\n“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s living\\nwith Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too…”\\n“...and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are\\nsuffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.\\n“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supp-\\norters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius\\nLovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin.\\n“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.\\n“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” – all\\nthree of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence – “well-\\nknown gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within\\nthe grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support\\nHarry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into\\ncustody, and is, we believe, on the run.”\\n“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a\\nsixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.\\n“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just\\nadd that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n385\\nurge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hag-\\nrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.”\\n“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you continue\\nto show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to\\nPotterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is\\nproving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief\\nDeath Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors\\ncirculating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent.”\\n“‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Her-\\nmione cried out together:\\n“Fred!”\\n“No – is it George?”\\n“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was\\nsaid, “I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier’!”\\n“Oh, all right then. ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the\\nvarious stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?”\\n“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know, unless they’ve\\ntaken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar,\\nYouKnow-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice\\nlittle climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are\\ngenuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around\\nthe place.”\\n“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery is creat-\\ning more terror than actually showing himself.”\\n“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things\\nare bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea\\nthat You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a\\nbasilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring\\nat you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it\\nreally is YouKnow-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n386\\nFor the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel\\nthe weight of tension leaving him.\\n“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked Lee.\\n“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s\\nbeen putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false\\nsense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he\\nisn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted\\nwith shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way\\naway if you’re planning on taking any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself\\nsay it, but safety first!”\\n“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee. “Listen-\\ners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when\\nit will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back.\\nKeep twiddling those dials: The next password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep\\neach other safe: Keep faith. Good night.”\\nThe radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly\\nvoices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their\\nisolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Volde-\\nmort. It was like waking from a long sleep.\\n“Good, eh?” said Ron happily. “Brilliant,” said Harry.\\n“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they were\\nfound...”\\n“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.”\\n“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now the\\nbroadcast was over, his thoughts turned again toward his all-consuming\\nobsession. “He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!”\\n“Harry –”\\n“Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol–”\\n“HARRY, NO!”\\n“– demort’s after the Elder Wand!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n387\\n“The name’s Taboo!” Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack\\nsounded outside the tent. “I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it any-\\nmore – we’ve got to put the protection back around us – quickly – it’s how\\nthey find –”\\nBut Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the\\ntable had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and\\nnearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket\\nand clicked it: Their lamps went out.\\n“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through\\nthe darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands\\npointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n388\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\\nMALFOY MANOR\\nH\\narry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness.\\nHe saw Hermione point her wand, not toward the outside, but into his face;\\nthere was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to\\nsee. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy foot-\\nfalls surrounded him. “Get up, vermin.”\\nUnknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground. Before he could\\nstop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the\\nblackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which\\nfelt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though\\nhe had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced\\nto slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was\\nbundled out of the tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of\\nfour or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too.\\n“Get – off – her!” Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of\\nknuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No!\\nLeave him alone, leave him alone!”\\n“Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on\\nmy list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “Delicious girl... What a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n389\\ntreat... I do enjoy the softness of the skin…”\\nHarry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was: Fenrir Greyback,\\nthe werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his\\nhired savagery.\\n“Search the tent!” said another voice.\\nHarry was thrown facedown onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron\\nhad been cast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the\\nmen were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched.\\n“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice from\\noverhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wandlight\\nfell into his face and Greyback laughed.\\n“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you,\\nugly?”\\nHarry did not answer immediately.\\n“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm\\nthat made him double over in pain, “what happened to you?”\\n“Stung,” Harry muttered. “Been stung.”\\n“Yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice. “What’s your name?” snarled\\nGreyback. “Dudley,” said Harry.\\n“And your first name?”\\n“I – Vernon. Vernon Dudley.”\\n“Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry heard him move\\nsideways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about you, ginger?”\\n“Stan Shunpike,” said Ron.\\n“Like ‘ell you are,” said the man called Scabior. “We know Stan Shun-\\npike, ‘e’s put a bit of work our way.”\\nThere was another thud.\\n“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of\\nblood. “Bardy Weadley.”\\n“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood traitors even\\nif you’re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend...” The relish\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n390\\nin his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl.\\n“Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others.\\n“Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at\\nremembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?”\\n“Penelope Clearwater,” said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but con-\\nvincing.\\n“What’s your blood status?”\\n“Half-blood,” said Hermione.\\n“Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ‘ole lot of ‘em look like\\nthey could still be ‘ogwarts age –”\\n“We’b lebt,” said Ron.\\n“Left, ‘ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “And you decided to go camping?\\nAnd you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark Lord’s name?”\\n“Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.”\\n“Accident?” There was more jeering laughter.\\n“You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name, Weasley?”\\ngrowled Greyback. “The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?”\\n“Doh.”\\n“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been\\nTabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see.\\nBind them up with the other two prisoners!”\\nSomeone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed\\nhim down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with\\nother people. Harry was still half blind, barely able to see anything through\\nhis puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying them had walked away,\\nHarry whispered to the other prisoners.\\n“Anyone still got a wand?”\\n“No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. “This is all my\\nfault. I said the name, I’m sorry –”\\n“Harry?”\\nIt was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from directly behind Harry,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n391\\nfrom the person tied to Hermione’s left.\\n“Dean?”\\n“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got –! They’re Snatchers, they’re\\nonly looking for truants to sell for gold –”\\n“Not a bad little haul for one night,” Greyback was saying, as a pair of\\nhobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from\\ninside the tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and three truants. You\\nchecked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he roared.\\n“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley on ‘ere, Greyback.”\\n“Interesting,” said Greyback. “That’s interesting.”\\nHe crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap\\nleft between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and\\nwhiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth.\\nGreyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore\\nhad died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.\\n“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a\\ndifferent name? What House were you in at Hogwarts?”\\n“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically.\\n“Funny ‘ow they all thinks we wants to ‘ear that,” jeered Scabior out of\\nthe shadows. “But none of ‘em can tell us where the common room is.”\\n“It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the wall.\\nIt’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s all green.”\\nThere was a short pause.\\n“Well, well, looks like we really ‘ave caught a little Slytherin,” said\\nScabior. “Good for you, Vernon, ‘cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood Sly-\\ntherins. Who’s your father?”\\n“He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that his whole story\\nwould collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he\\nonly had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was\\nup in any case. “Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.”\\n“You know what, Greyback,” said Scabior. “I think there is a Dudley in\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n392\\nthere.”\\nHarry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out\\nof this?\\n“Well, well,” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of\\ntrepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering\\nwhether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official.\\nHarry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not\\nhave been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling\\nthe truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I\\nexpect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.”\\n“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us –”\\n“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this, Greyback!”\\nA dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver\\nin the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s sword.\\n“Ve-e-ry nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his comp-\\nanion. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get\\nsomething like this?”\\n“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark\\nfor Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to\\ncut firewood –”\\n“‘ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!”\\nAs Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his\\ndistended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out\\nanything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black\\nand forbidding; Voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp\\nagain; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly\\neuphoric purpose...\\nSo close... So close...\\nWith a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort’s thoughts,\\npulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and\\nGriphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n393\\n“‘‘ermione Granger,’” Scabior was saying, “‘the Mudblood who is\\nknown to be traveling with ‘arry Potter.’”\\nHarry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep\\nhimself present, not to slip into Voldemort’s mind. He heard the creak of\\nGreyback’s boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione.\\n“You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.”\\n“It isn’t! It isn’t me!”\\nHermione’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession.\\n“‘...known to be traveling with Harry Potter,’” repeated Greyback\\nquietly.\\nA stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar was exquisitely\\npainful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort’s\\nthoughts: It had never been so important to remain in his own right mind.\\n“Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” whispered Greyback. Nobody\\nspoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt\\nHermione’s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a couple\\nof steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his\\nmisshapen features.\\n“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul\\nin Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar.\\n“Don’t touch it!” Harry yelled; he could not stop himself; he thought he\\nmight be sick from the pain of it.\\n“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback.\\n“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the back-\\nground. “There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait –”\\nAnd seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face.\\nThe Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him. “It is!” rasped Grey-\\nback. “We’ve caught Potter!”\\nThey all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done.\\nHarry, still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head, could\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n394\\nthink of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the\\nsurface of his mind –\\n– He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress – No, he\\nwas Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger –\\n– looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower –\\nHe was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices –\\n– Time to fly...\\n“...to the Ministry?”\\n“To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback. “They’ll take the credit,\\nand we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.”\\n“Will you summon ‘im? ‘ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified.\\n“No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t got – they say he’s using the Malfoys’\\nplace as a base. We’ll take the boy there.”\\nHarry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The\\nwerewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to\\nuse him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the Dark\\nMark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honor.\\nHarry’s scar seared again –\\n– and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at the very\\ntop of the tower –\\n“... completely sure it’s him? ‘Cause if it ain’t, Greyback, we’re dead.”\\n“Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment of in-\\nadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred\\nthousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any\\nof you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in!”\\n– The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a\\nman to enter... A skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath\\na blanket... Dead, or sleeping...?\\n“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about the rest of\\n‘em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ‘em?”\\n“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s another ten\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n395\\nGalleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies, that’s another small\\nfortune right there.”\\nThe prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione’s\\nbreathing, fast and terrified.\\n“Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback, seizing a\\nfistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his\\nscalp. “On three! One – two – three –”\\nThey Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled,\\ntrying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione\\nwere squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could not separate from\\nthe group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more\\npainfully still –\\n– as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and\\nlanded, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room –\\nThe prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane.\\nHarry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair\\nof wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He\\nexperienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened yet:\\nVoldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist\\nthe vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How\\nlong it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry\\nwas here, was another matter...\\nOne of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.\\n“How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I can’t – blimey!”\\nHe whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting\\nitself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke\\nin a clanging, echoing voice: “State your purpose!”\\n“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve captured\\nHarry Potter!”\\nThe gates swung open.\\n“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n396\\nthrough the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their\\nfootsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was\\nan albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback;\\nnow he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other\\nprisoners. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to over-\\ncome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing,\\nwhether he knew yet that Harry was caught...\\nThe emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over\\ntoward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face... The frail man sat up, great\\nsunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of\\nhis teeth were gone...\\n“So, you have come. I thought you would... one day. But your journey\\nwas pointless. I never had it.”\\n“You lie!”\\nAs Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s scar threatened to\\nburst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting\\nto remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel.\\nLight spilled out over all of them.\\n“What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice.\\n“We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” rasped Greyback.\\n“Who are you?”\\n“You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf’s voice. “Fenrir\\nGreyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!”\\nGreyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing\\nthe other prisoners to shuffle around too.\\n“I know ‘e’s swollen, ma’am, but it’s ‘im!” piped up Scabior. “If you\\nlook a bit closer, you’ll see ‘is scar. And this ‘ere, see the girl? The Mud-\\nblood who’s been traveling around with ‘im, ma’am. There’s no doubt it’s\\n‘im, and we’ve got ‘is wand as well! ‘Ere, ma’am –”\\nThrough his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his\\nswollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eye-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n397\\nbrows.\\n“Bring them in,” she said.\\nHarry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a\\nhallway lined with portraits.\\n“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “My son,\\nDraco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.”\\nThe drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes\\nalmost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A\\ncrystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more portraits against the dark\\npurple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble\\nfireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.\\n“What is this?”\\nThe dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry’s\\nears. He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and it was easier, as\\nhis fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts, though his scar was\\nstill burning.\\n“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice. “Draco, come\\nhere.”\\nHarry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely: a figure\\nslightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and\\npointed blur beneath white-blond hair.\\nGreyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly\\nbeneath the chandelier.\\n“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf.\\nHarry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an\\nintricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own\\nreflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place.\\nHis face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione’s\\njinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow\\naround his jaw. Had he not known that it was he who stood there, he would\\nhave wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n398\\nhis voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with\\nDraco as the latter approached.\\n“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it? Is it Harry\\nPotter?”\\n“I can’t – I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his distance from\\nGreyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking\\nat him.\\n“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!”\\nHarry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.\\n“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord,\\neverything will be forgiv –”\\n“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr.\\nMalfoy?” said Greyback menacingly.\\n“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently. He approached\\nHarry himself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale\\nface in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy\\nmask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a\\ncage.\\n“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did he get into\\nthis state?”\\n“That wasn’t us.”\\n“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius. His gray eyes raked\\nHarry’s forehead.\\n“There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, stretched\\ntight Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”\\nHarry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s. They were\\nextraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with\\nexcitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.\\n“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where\\nhis mother stood watching.\\n“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n399\\ncold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the\\nDark Lord... They say this is his” – she was looking closely at the blackthorn\\nwand – “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description If we are\\nmistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing Remember what he did\\nto Rowle and Dolohov?”\\n“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly\\nthrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around\\nagain, so that the light fell on Hermione instead.\\n“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes – yes, she was in Madam Malkin’s\\nwith Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Gran-\\nger girl?”\\n“I... maybe yeah.”\\n“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the\\nbound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s friends – Draco, look at\\nhim, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name –?”\\n“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could be.”\\nThe drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the\\nsound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.\\n“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”\\nBellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on\\nHarry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.\\n“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Gran-\\nger?”\\n“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!\\nPotter and his friends, caught at last!”\\n“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in\\nHarry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”\\nShe dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into\\nthe flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon\\nher beloved master –\\n“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n400\\nBellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “I shall summon\\nhim, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon\\nmy authority –”\\n“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his\\ngrasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare\\nyou! Take your hands off me!”\\n“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy –”\\n“Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected Greyback, “but it’s us\\nthat caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold –”\\n“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-\\nlaw, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “Take your gold,\\nfilthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the honor of his –\\nof –”\\nShe stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could\\nnot see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and\\nripped up his own sleeve –\\n“STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix. “Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the\\nDark Lord comes now!”\\nLucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix\\nstrode out of Harry’s limited line of vision. “What is that?” he heard her\\nsay.\\n“Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher. “Give it to me.”\\n“It’s not yorn, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.”\\nThere was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry knew that the Snatcher\\nhad been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew\\nhis wand.\\n“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?”\\n“Stupefy!” she screamed. “Stupefy!”\\nThey were no match for her, even though there were four of them against\\none of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no\\nconscience. They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n401\\nforced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the corners of\\nhis eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of\\nGryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.\\n“Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Greyback as she pulled\\nhis wand out of his unresisting grip.\\n“How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move\\nas he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. “Release me,\\nwoman!”\\n“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in his face.\\n“Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!”\\n“It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I say!”\\nShe waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared\\ntoo wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved\\nnails clutching its back.\\n“Draco, move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, indicating the uncon-\\nscious men. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in\\nthe courtyard for me.”\\n“Don’t you dare speak to Draco like –” said Narcissa furiously, but\\nBellatrix screamed, “Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly\\nimagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!”\\nShe stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt.\\nThen she turned to look at the silent prisoners.\\n“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered, more to\\nherself than to the others. “The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter\\nhimself... But if he finds out... I must... I must know…”\\nShe turned back to her sister again.\\n“The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!”\\n“This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in my –”\\n“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bellatrix.\\nShe looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and\\nburned a hole in the carpet.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n402\\nNarcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. “Take\\nthese prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.”\\n“Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except except for the Mudblood.”\\nGreyback gave a grunt of pleasure.\\n“No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!”\\nBellatrix hit him across the face; the blow echoed around the room.\\n“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said. “Blood traitor\\nis next to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and\\nmake sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them – yet.”\\nShe threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife\\nfrom under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then\\ndragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced\\nthe rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark passageway,\\nhis wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible\\nforce.\\n“Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished with her?”\\nGreyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. “I’d say I’ll get a\\nbite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?”\\nHarry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of\\nstairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their\\nnecks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked\\nit with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and\\nleft them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door\\nhad not died away before there was a terrible, drawn-out scream from di-\\nrectly above them.\\n“HERMIONE!” Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle\\nagainst the ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. “HER-\\nMIONE!”\\n“Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up, Ron, we need to work out a way –”\\n“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”\\n“We need a plan, stop yelling – we need to get these ropes off –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n403\\n“Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “Ron? Is that you?”\\nRon stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them,\\nthen Harry saw a shadow moving closer.\\n“Harry? Ron?”\\n“Luna?”\\n“Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!”\\n“Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry.\\n“Oh yes, I expect so... There’s an old nail we use if we need to break\\nanything... Just a moment...”\\nHermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix\\nscreaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, “HER-\\nMIONE! HERMIONE!”\\n“Mr. Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying. “Mr. Ollivander, have\\nyou got the nail? If you just move over a little bit... I think it was beside the\\nwater jug…”\\nShe was back within seconds. “You’ll need to stay still,” she said.\\nHarry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work the knots\\nfree. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice.\\n“I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?”\\n“We found it – we found it – PLEASE!” Hermione screamed again; Ron\\nstruggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry’s wrist.\\n“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered. “I can’t see what I’m doing –”\\n“My pocket!” said Ron. “In my pocket, there’s a Deluminator, and it’s\\nfull of light!”\\nA few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the\\nDeluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar:\\nUnable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns,\\nflooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her\\nwhite face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled\\nup on the floor in the corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow\\nprisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n404\\nkept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.\\n“Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, and she began hacking\\nat their bindings again. “Hello, Dean!”\\nFrom above came Bellatrix’s voice.\\n“You are lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside\\nmy vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!”\\nAnother terrible scream – “HERMIONE!”\\n“What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I\\nswear, I shall run you through with this knife!”\\n“There!”\\nHarry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron\\nrunning around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a\\ntrapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said “Thanks” to Luna and\\nstood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking\\ngroggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face.\\nRon was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.\\n“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. “The\\ncellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been\\nhere for a long time, he’s tried everything.”\\nHermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like\\nphysical pain. Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too\\nstarted to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what,\\nknowing in his heart that it was useless.\\n“What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!”\\nHermione’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing\\nas he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized\\nHagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out\\nDumbledore’s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what – noth-\\ning happened – he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they\\nwere lifeless – the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a\\ngleam of brightest blue –\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n405\\nDumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.\\n“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in the cellar of\\nMalfoy Manor, help us!”\\nThe eye blinked and was gone.\\nHarry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard\\nof mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls\\nand ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than\\never, and next to him Ron was bellowing, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”\\n“How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream. “Did that\\ndirty little goblin in the cellar help you?”\\n“We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed. “We’ve never been inside\\nyour vault It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy!”\\n“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!”\\n“But we can find out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. “Draco, fetch the gob-\\nlin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!”\\nHarry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the\\nfloor.\\n“Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell\\nthem that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook,\\nplease –”\\nHe could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next moment,\\nDraco’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door.\\n“Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill\\nyou!”\\nThey did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Delumi-\\nnator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s\\ndarkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in\\nfront of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and\\nbacked out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and\\nat the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar.\\nRon clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n406\\nfrom his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated\\ninto their midst.\\n“DOB –!”\\nHarry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified\\nat his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching\\nGriphook to Bellatrix.\\nDobby’s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling\\nfrom his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old\\nmasters, and it was clear that he was petrified.\\n“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has\\ncome to rescue you.”\\n“But how did you –?”\\nAn awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being tortured\\nagain. He cut to the essentials.\\n“You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who nodded,\\nhis ears flapping.\\n“And you can take humans with you?” Dobby nodded again.\\n“Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and\\ntake them – take them to –”\\n“Bill and Fleur’s,” said Ron. “Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tin-\\nworth!” The elf nodded for a third time.\\n“And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, Dobby?”\\n“Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr.\\nOllivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the\\nwandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean,\\nneither of whom moved.\\n“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered. “We can’t leave you\\nhere,” said Dean.\\n“Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.”\\nAs Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds\\nhe looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n407\\nas old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully.\\n“Kill me, then, Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring\\nyou what you seek... There is so much you do not understand…”\\nHe felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out,\\nreturning to the cellar and the horror of his own present.\\n“Go!” Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow, just go!”\\nThey caught hold of the elf’s outstretched fingers. There was another loud\\ncrack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished.\\n“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. “Did you\\nhear that? What was that noise in the cellar?”\\nHarry and Ron stared at each other.\\n“Draco – no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!”\\nFootsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew\\nthat the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the\\ncellar.\\n“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ron. They\\nhad no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence\\nof three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,” Harry added, and\\nas they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed\\nagainst the wall on either side of it.\\n“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the door. I am\\ncoming in.”\\nThe door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the appa-\\nrently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating\\nin midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized\\nWormtail’s wand arm and forced it upward; Harry slapped a hand to his\\nmouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail’s wand emi-\\ntted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry’s throat.\\n“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above.\\n“Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail’s whee-\\nzy voice. “All fine!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n408\\nHarry could barely breathe.\\n“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the\\nmetal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!”\\nThe silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched\\nhimself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail’s mouth. He saw\\nthe ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed\\njust as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful\\nimpulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as\\nthough to undo that moment of weakness.\\n“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand from\\nhis other hand.\\nWandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid\\nfrom Harry’s face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving\\ninexorably toward his own throat.\\n“No –”\\nWithout pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was\\nno stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly\\nservant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was\\nreaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being\\nstrangled before their eyes.\\n“No!”\\nRon had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull\\nthe crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use.\\nPettigrew was turning blue.\\n“Relashio!” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing\\nhappened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Her-\\nmione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail’s eyes rolled up-\\nward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still.\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the\\nfloor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway\\nleading to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n409\\nreached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear view\\nof Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor’s\\nsword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet.\\nShe was barely stirring.\\n“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?”\\nHarry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar.\\n“No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.”\\n“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?”\\n“Yes,” said the goblin.\\nRelief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.\\n“Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another\\ndeep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She\\nkicked him aside. “And now,” she said in a voice that burst with triumph,\\n“we call the Dark Lord!”\\nAnd she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark\\nMark.\\nAt once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true\\nsurroundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before\\nhim was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt\\n– he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less\\nthan Potter. If they were mistaken...\\n“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not win, you cannot\\nwin! That wand will never, ever be yours –”\\nAnd Voldemort’s fury broke: A burst of green light filled the prison room\\nand the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless,\\nand Voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable... They\\nwould suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him\\nback...\\n“And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the Mudblood.\\nGreyback, take her if you want her.”\\n“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n410\\nRon had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked;\\nshe turned her wand to face Ron instead –\\n“Expelliarmus!” he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand at Bellatrix, and\\nhers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron.\\nLucius, Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled,\\n“Stupefy!” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew\\nfrom Draco’s, Narcissa’s, and Greyback’s wands; Harry threw himself to\\nthe floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.\\n“STOP OR SHE DIES!”\\nPanting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was support-\\ning Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short\\nsilver knife to Hermione’s throat.\\n“Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see exactly how\\nfilthy her blood is!”\\nRon stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry straightened up, still\\nholding Bellatrix’s.\\n“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione’s\\nthroat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.\\n“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the floor\\nat his feet. Ron did the same with Wormtail’s. Both raised their hands to\\nshoulder height.\\n“Good!” she leered. “Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming,\\nHarry Potter! Your death approaches!”\\nHarry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel\\nVoldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy\\nsea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry\\ncould see no way out.\\n“Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands,\\n“Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback\\ntakes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge\\nyou the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n411\\nAt the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of\\nthem looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with\\na creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly\\nbeneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream. The\\nchandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling\\non top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of\\nGryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled\\nover, his hands covering his bloody face.\\nAs Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance:\\nHe leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip,\\npointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was\\nlifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed\\nto the ground.\\nAs Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix\\nsprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but\\nNarcissa had directed her wand at the doorway.\\n“Dobby!” she screamed, and even Bellatrix froze. “You! You dropped\\nthe chandelier –?”\\nThe tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old\\nmistress.\\n“You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked.\\n“Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack,\\nand Narcissa’s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the\\nroom.\\n“You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare you take a\\nwitch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?”\\n“Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby\\nhas come to save Harry Potter and his friends!”\\nHarry’s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had\\nmoments, seconds before Voldemort was with them.\\n“Ron, catch – and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him;\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n412\\nthen he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting\\nthe groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry\\nseized Dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate.\\nAs he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room:\\nof the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that\\nwas Ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife flew across\\nthe room at the place where he was vanishing –\\nBill and Fleur’s... Shell Cottage... Bill and Fleur’s...\\nHe had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the\\nname of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The\\npain in his forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down\\nupon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor’s sword bumping against\\nhis back; Dobby’s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was\\ntrying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeez-\\ning the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with him...\\nAnd then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees,\\nrelinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the\\nground.\\n“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely\\nwhimpered.\\nHarry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a\\ncottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw\\nmovement outside it.\\n“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two wands\\nhe had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed to. “Have we\\ncome to the right place? Dobby?”\\nHe looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. “DOBBY!”\\nThe elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes.\\nTogether, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding\\nfrom the elf’s heaving chest.\\n“Dobby – no – HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n413\\npeople moving there. “HELP!”\\nHe did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends\\nor foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across\\nDobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a\\nlook of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool\\ngrass.\\n“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die –”\\nThe elf’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form\\nwords.\\n“Harry... Potter...”\\nAnd then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were\\nnothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they\\ncould not see.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n414\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\\nTHE WANDMAKER\\nI\\nt was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again\\nbeside Dumbledore’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but\\nin reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by\\nBellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby… Dobby...”\\neven though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back.\\nAfter a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right\\nplace, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him\\nas he knelt over the elf.\\n“Hermione?” he said suddenly. “Where is she?”\\n“Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.”\\nHarry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled\\nthe sharp blade from the elf’s body, then dragged off his own jacket and\\ncovered Dobby in it like a blanket.\\nThe sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it\\nwhile the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no\\ninterest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the\\nhouse, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about\\nburying the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n415\\nAs he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and\\nburned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a\\nlong telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at\\nMalfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for Dobby\\nseemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry\\nfrom across a vast, silent ocean.\\n“I want to do it properly,” were the first words of which Harry was fully\\nconscious of speaking. “Not by magic. Have you got a spade?”\\nAnd shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the\\nplace that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He\\ndug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-\\nmagic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to\\nthe elf who had saved their lives.\\nHis scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart\\nfrom it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Volde-\\nmort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just\\nas Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed\\nwith grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while\\nhe mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out... though Dum-\\nbledore, of course, would have said that it was love...\\nOn Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his\\ngrief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing\\nbut the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company,\\nthe things that had happened at the Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he\\nhad heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness...\\nThe steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows...\\nHorcruxes... Hallows... Horcruxes... Yet he no longer burned with that\\nweird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: He felt as though\\nhe had been slapped awake again.\\nDeeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where\\nVoldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n416\\nNurmengard, and why...\\nAnd he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious\\nimpulse of mercy... Dumbledore had foreseen that... How much more had\\nhe known?\\nHarry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a\\nfew degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean.\\n“How’s Hermione?”\\n“Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after her.”\\nHarry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply\\ncreated a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped\\ndown into the hole he had made with spades of their own, and together they\\nworked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough.\\nHarry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of\\nthe grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the\\nelf’s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully\\nupon Dobby’s head, muffling his batlike ears.\\n“We should close his eyes.”\\nHarry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was\\nwearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of\\nwhich protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Her-\\nmione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her\\nfeet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was\\nhuddled in one of Fleur’s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers\\ntenderly upon each of the elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare.\\n“There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.”\\nHarry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he\\nmight have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon\\nthe little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered\\nDumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the\\nMinister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achieve-\\nments, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n417\\njust as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly\\ndug hole.\\n“I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall\\nI?”\\nAnd as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom\\nof the grave.\\n“Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so\\nunfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always\\nremember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.”\\nShe turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said\\nin a thick voice, “Yeah... thanks, Dobby.”\\n“Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed.\\n“Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had\\nsaid it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave\\nrose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound.\\n“D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others.\\nThey murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back,\\nand then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone\\nbeside the elf.\\nHe looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed\\nby the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the\\nlargest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now\\nrested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand.\\nThere were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now\\nremember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching\\nthem out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt\\nfriendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.\\nSlowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the\\nrock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and\\nprobably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to\\ndig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n418\\nHERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.\\nHe looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked\\naway, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that\\nhad come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness,\\nideas both fascinating and terrible.\\nThey were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall,\\ntheir attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-\\ncolored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fire-\\nplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the\\ndoorway, listening.\\n“... lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts, they could\\nhave taken her before we reached her. Now we know she’s safe too.”\\nHe looked around and saw Harry standing there.\\n“I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he explained. “Moved\\nthem to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re\\nbound to target the family – don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of\\nHarry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so\\nfor months. We’re the biggest blood-traitor family there is.”\\n“How are they protected?” asked Harry.\\n“Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage\\ntoo; I’m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly\\nthe most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well\\nenough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There isn’t much room here, but\\nshe’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the mend, Fleur’s given him Skele-\\nGro; we could probably move them in an hour or –”\\n“No,” Harry said, and Bill looked startled. “I need both of them here. I\\nneed to talk to them. It’s important.”\\nHe heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense of\\npurpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of their faces\\nwere turned toward him, looking puzzled.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n419\\n“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands, still\\ncovered in mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see them, straight-\\naway.”\\nHe walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window over-\\nlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly\\ngold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to\\nhim in the dark garden...\\nDobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar,\\nbut Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the\\nmirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at\\nHogwarts to those who ask for it.\\nHarry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the\\nwindow and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked\\nout over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the\\nheart of it all.\\nAnd still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there\\ntoo. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling\\nhim one thing, his brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry’s head\\nsmiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if\\nin prayer.\\nYou gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him... You gave him a\\nway back...\\nAnd you understood Wormtail too... You knew there was a bit of regret\\nthere, somewhere...\\nAnd if you knew them What did you know about me, Dumbledore?\\nAm I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I’d find\\nthat?\\nIs that why you made it this difficult? So I’d have time to work that out?\\nHarry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright\\ngold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down\\nat his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n420\\nholding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so,\\nhe felt his scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across his mind, swift as the\\nreflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew\\nextremely well.\\nBill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs.\\n“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said.\\n“No,” said Fleur. “You will ‘ave to wait, ‘Arry. Zey are both ill, tired –”\\n“I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them\\nnow. Privately – and separately. It’s urgent.”\\n“Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You turn up here with a\\ndead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s\\nbeen tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me anything –”\\n“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. “You’re in the\\nOrder, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not supposed to\\ntalk about it to anyone else.”\\nFleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring\\nat Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally Bill said, “All\\nright. Who do you want to talk to first?”\\nHarry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly\\nany time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows?\\n“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.”\\nHis heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an\\nenormous obstacle.\\n“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way.\\nHarry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back.\\n“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been\\nskulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.\\nThey both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.\\n“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were amazing – coming\\nup with that story when she was hurting you like that –”\\nHermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n421\\n“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked.\\n“You’ll see. Come on.”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small\\nlanding. Three doors led off it.\\n“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room. It too had\\na view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the\\nwindow, turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms\\nfolded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table;\\nRon sat on the arm.\\nBill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully\\nupon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon\\nthem all.\\n“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your legs?”\\n“Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.”\\nHe was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look:\\nhalf truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin, his long\\nthin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were\\ndirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was\\nmuch bigger than a human’s.\\n“You probably don’t remember –” Harry began.\\n“– that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you\\never visited Gringotts?” said Griphook. “I remember, Harry Potter. Even\\namongst goblins, you are very famous.”\\nHarry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry’s\\nscar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with\\nGriphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move.\\nWhile he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin\\nbroke the silence.\\n“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. “I\\nwatched you from the window of the bedroom next door.”\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n422\\nGriphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.\\n“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.”\\n“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. “You dug the\\ngrave.”\\n“So?”\\nGriphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at\\nfor acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to him whether\\nGriphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gathered himself for the\\nattack.\\n“Griphook, I need to ask –”\\n“You also rescued a goblin.”\\n“What?”\\n“You brought me here. Saved me.”\\n“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently.\\n“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the\\nthin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.”\\n“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give\\nit to me.”\\nThe goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at\\nHarry as though he had never seen anything like him.\\n“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.”\\nHarry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from him\\nas pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of\\nHogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first.\\nRon and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.\\n“Harry –” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.\\n“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he\\nshifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.”\\n“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birth-\\nday, seven years ago.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n423\\n“The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the goblin, and\\nHarry understood that even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was\\noffended at the idea of its defenses being breached. “Its protection was mini-\\nmal.”\\n“Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guessing its\\nprotection will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs to the\\nLestranges.”\\nHe saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would\\nbe time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer.\\n“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No chance at all. If you\\nseek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours –”\\n“Thief, you have been warned, beware – yeah, I know, I remember,” said\\nHarry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take\\nanything for personal gain. Can you believe that?”\\nThe goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry’s\\nforehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its\\ninvitation.\\n“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek\\npersonal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry Potter. Gob-\\nlins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have\\nshown this night. Not from wand-carriers.”\\n“Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as\\nhis scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry\\nburned to question Ollivander next door.\\n“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long been con-\\ntested between wizards and goblins.”\\n“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron.\\n“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with\\nother magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!”\\n“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron. “You\\nwon’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n424\\nhow to work metal in a way wizards have never –”\\n“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color. “This\\nisn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature –”\\nGriphook gave a nasty laugh.\\n“But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more\\npowerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under\\nWizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-\\ncarriers protests?”\\n“We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. “We\\nprotest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m\\na Mudblood!”\\n“Don’t call yourself –” Ron muttered.\\n“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of it! I’ve got\\nno higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me\\nthey chose to torture, back at the Malfoys’!”\\nAs she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal\\nthe thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat.\\n“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she asked. “Did\\nyou know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron fidgeted\\nuncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t want You-\\nKnow-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!”\\nThe goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown\\nHarry.\\n“What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he asked abruptly.\\n“The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.” He looked from\\none to the other of them. “I think that you already know this. You asked me\\nto lie for you back there.”\\n“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked Harry.\\n“Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?”\\nHis heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to\\nignore the pulsing of his scar.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n425\\nThe goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.\\n“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the\\nguardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our\\ncare, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.”\\nThe goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to\\nHermione to Ron and then back again.\\n“So young,” he said finally, “to be fighting so many.”\\n“Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope of breaking in\\nwithout a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.”\\n“I shall... think about it,” said Griphook maddeningly.\\n“But –” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. “Thank\\nyou,” said Harry.\\nThe goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed\\nhis short legs.\\n“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur’s\\nbed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last.\\nForgive me…”\\n“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned\\nforward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook\\ndid not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as\\nhe closed the door upon him.\\n“Little git,” whispered Ron. “He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.”\\n“Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door,\\ninto the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying what I think you’re\\nsaying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges’ vault?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been\\nin there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we’d seen, what\\nelse did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-\\nKnowWho would find out about.”\\n“But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s been,\\nplaces he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking baffled. “Was he\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n426\\never inside the Lestranges’ vault?”\\n“I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry. “He\\nnever had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him any-\\nthing. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time\\nhe ever went to Diagon Alley.”\\nHarry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to\\nunderstand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.\\n“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault.\\nI think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding\\nworld. And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were\\nhis most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after\\nhe vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.”\\nHarry rubbed his scar.\\n“I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never\\ntold Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a\\ntreasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place\\nin the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me... except for\\nHogwarts.”\\nWhen Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. “You really\\nunderstand him.”\\n“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits... I just wish I’d understood Dumbledore\\nas much. But we’ll see. Come on – Ollivander now.”\\nRon and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they followed\\nhim across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and\\nFleur’s. A weak “Come in!” answered them.\\nThe wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He\\nhad been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew,\\non at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking\\nout sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in\\ntheir sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have\\nbelonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n427\\nHermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top\\ngarden and the freshly dug grave.\\n“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said.\\n“My dear boy.” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us. I thought\\nwe would die in that place. I can never thank you... never thank you...\\nenough.”\\n“We were glad to do it.”\\nHarry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any\\ntime left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart\\nhim. He felt a flutter of panic... yet he had made his decision when he chose\\nto speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the\\npouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand.\\n“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.”\\n“Anything. Anything,” said the wandmaker weakly. “Can you mend this?\\nIs it possible?”\\nOllivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely\\nconnected halves into his palm.\\n“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a tremulous voice.\\n“Eleven inches. Nice and supple.”\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Can you –?”\\n“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has\\nsuffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know\\nof.”\\nHarry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took\\nthe wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck.\\nOllivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and\\ndid not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he\\nhad brought from the Malfoys’.\\n“Can you identify these?” Harry asked.\\nThe wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded\\neyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n428\\n“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “Twelve-and-three-quarter in-\\nches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.”\\n“And this one?”\\nOllivander performed the same examination.\\n“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy.\\nThis was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”\\n“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?”\\n“Perhaps not. If you took it –”\\n“– I did –”\\n“– then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much\\nalso depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has\\nbeen won, its allegiance will change.”\\nThere was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea.\\n“You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry, “like they can\\nthink for themselves.”\\n“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has always\\nbeen clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.”\\n“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?” asked\\nHarry.\\n“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your\\nmagic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must\\nalways come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand.\\nThese connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual\\nquest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from\\nthe wand.”\\nThe sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound.\\n“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can I use it\\nsafely?”\\n“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand\\nwill usually bend its will to its new master.”\\n“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand out of his\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n429\\npocket and handing it to Ollivander.\\n“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I\\nwas forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew.\\nYes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than\\nanother wand.”\\n“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry.\\n“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry’s face.\\n“You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious\\nbranch of magic.”\\n“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession\\nof a wand?” asked Harry.\\nOllivander swallowed.\\n“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.”\\n“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened,\\nthe pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort had\\ndecided to put his idea into action. “Legends about a wand – or wands – that\\nhave passed from hand to hand by murder.”\\nOllivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and\\nhis eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear.\\n“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered.\\n“And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry.\\n“I – how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and\\nHermione for help. “How do you know this?”\\n“He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our\\nwands,” said Harry.\\nOllivander looked terrified.\\n“He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I – I\\nhad no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!”\\n“I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the twin cores? You said\\nhe just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?”\\nOllivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n430\\nHe nodded slowly.\\n“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat the borrowed wand.\\nDo you know why that is?”\\nOllivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded.\\n“I had... never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something\\nunique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet\\nwhy your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know…”\\n“We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by\\nmurder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something\\nstrange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn’t he?”\\n“How do you know this?” Harry did not answer.\\n“Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to know everything\\nI could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the\\nWand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.”\\nHarry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted.\\n“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, “had\\nalways been happy with the wand I made him – yew and phoenix feather,\\nthirteen-and-a-half inches – until he discovered the connection of the twin\\ncores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to\\nconquer yours.”\\n“But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond\\nrepair,” said Harry quietly.\\n“No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t know that, Harry,\\nhow could he –?”\\n“Priori Incantatem,” said Harry. “We left your wand and the blackthorn\\nwand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them\\nre-create the spells they’ve cast lately, they’ll see that yours broke mine,\\nthey’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve\\nbeen using the blackthorn one ever since.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n431\\nThe little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her\\nface. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about\\nthat now –”\\nBut Mr. Ollivander intervened.\\n“The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your de-\\nstruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it\\nwill make him truly invulnerable.”\\n“And will it?”\\n“The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,” said Ollivander,\\n“but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must\\nadmit... formidable.”\\nHarry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first\\nmet, of how much he liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and\\nimprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this\\nwand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.\\n“You – you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?” asked\\nHermione.\\n“Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the\\nwand’s course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones,\\nwhere it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resur-\\nfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in\\nwandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that\\nI and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the\\nring of authenticity.”\\n“So you – you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” Hermione\\nasked hopefully.\\n“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not\\nknow. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is\\nsuch a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely\\npowerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fasci-\\nnation to all of us who study the power of wands.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n432\\n“Mr. Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told You-Know-Who that Gregorov-\\nitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”\\nOllivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped.\\n“But how – how do you –?”\\n“Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily\\nas his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street\\nin Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north. “You told\\nYouKnow-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?”\\n“It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander. “A rumor, years and years ago,\\nlong before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You\\ncan see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and dupli-\\ncating the qualities of the Elder Wand!”\\n“Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. Ollivander, one last\\nthing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the\\nDeathly Hallows?”\\n“The – the what?” asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.\\n“The Deathly Hallows.”\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still something\\nto do with wands?”\\nHarry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not\\nacting. He did not know about the Hallows.\\n“Thank you,” said Harry. “Thank you very much. We’ll leave you to get\\nsome rest now.”\\nOllivander looked stricken.\\n“He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus Curse... you have no\\nidea…”\\n“I do,” said Harry. “I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling\\nme all of this.”\\nHe led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a glimpse of\\nBill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in\\nfront of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n433\\nbut he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and\\nHermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay\\nahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and\\nmore powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that\\nwere forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist\\nonly a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know\\nthat his theory was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that\\nhe could explain to Ron and Hermione.\\n“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” he said. “I saw You-\\nKnow-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that\\nGregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindel-\\nwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know –\\nbut if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have\\nbeen that difficult.”\\nVoldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing\\nthere, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and\\ncloser.\\n“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the\\nheight of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could\\nstop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder\\nWand.”\\n“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But then – where is it\\nnow?”\\n“At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top\\ngarden.\\n“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and get it before\\nhe does!”\\n“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched\\nhis head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it is. He’s there now.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n434\\n“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known this – why have\\nwe been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have\\ngone – we could still go –”\\n“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermione’s\\nright. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it.\\nHe wanted me to get the Horcruxes.”\\n“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron.\\n“I’m not supposed to... I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes “\\nAnd now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over\\nthe horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward\\nthe lake.\\n“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold voice.\\n“Leave me now.”\\nSnape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing\\nbehind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s figure to disappear.\\nIt would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going.\\nBut there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal\\nhimself... and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm\\nthat hid him even from his own eyes.\\nAnd he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of\\nthe beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright...\\nAnd here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white\\nmarble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again\\nthat rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction.\\nHe raised the old yew wand: How fitting that this would be its last great act.\\nThe tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long\\nand thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.\\nThe wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet\\nalmost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked\\nnose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore’s hands were folded upon his\\nchest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried with him.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n435\\nHad the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand?\\nHad he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The\\nspiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore’s grasp,\\nand as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the\\ncorpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n436\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\\nSHELL COTTAGE\\nB\\nill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its\\nwalls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful\\nplace. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could\\nhear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great,\\nslumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses\\nto escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and\\nwide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.\\nThe enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still\\nscared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He\\nwas full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they\\nwere together.\\n“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get\\nthe wand?”\\n“What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get\\nthe Hallows?”\\n“Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to\\nfinish off You-Know-Who?”\\nHarry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n437\\nit had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open\\nthe tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided\\nagainst it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had\\nled to his decision, they sounded feebler to him.\\nThe odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just as con-\\nfused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real,\\nshe maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had\\ntaken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered.\\n“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said again and again. “You\\ncouldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.”\\nBut the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less than the\\npossibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore’s\\nintentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his\\npath but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs,\\nwhether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger\\nat Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming\\nthemselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had\\nnot explained before he died.\\n“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cott-\\nage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage\\ngarden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished\\nthey had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.\\n“Yes, he is, Ron, please don’t start that again!”\\n“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry, who\\ncontinued to gaze at the horizon. “The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry\\nsaw in the mirror –”\\n“Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don’t you, Harry?”\\n“I could have,” said Harry without looking at her.\\n“But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron. “No, I don’t,” said\\nHarry.\\n“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. “If\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n438\\nit wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar,\\nHermione?”\\n“I can’t – but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he’s\\nlying in a tomb at Hogwarts?”\\n“I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!”\\n“Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry. There was\\nlittle about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. “He\\nwould have gone on.”\\n“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry could say\\nany more, a voice behind them said, “‘Arry?”\\nFleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze.\\n“‘Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ‘E eez in ze smallest bed-\\nroom, ‘e says ‘e does not want to be over’eard.”\\nHer dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she\\nlooked irritable as she walked back around the house.\\nGriphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the\\ncottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He\\nhad drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave\\nthe room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.\\n“I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the goblin, who was\\nsitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fin-\\ngers. “Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have\\ndecided to help you –”\\n“That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. “Griphook, thank\\nyou, we’re really –”\\n“– in return,” said the goblin firmly, “for payment.” Slightly taken aback,\\nHarry hesitated.\\n“How much do you want? I’ve got gold.”\\n“Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.”\\nHis black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. “I want the\\nsword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.” Harry’s spirits plummeted.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n439\\n“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.”\\n“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.”\\n“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet the\\nLestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into\\nthe vault.”\\nHe had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.\\n“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have\\nno right!”\\n“The sword’s ours –”\\n“It is not,” said the goblin.\\n“We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s –”\\n“And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?” demanded the goblin,\\nsitting up straight.\\n“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?”\\n“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at\\nRon. “Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First’s,\\ntaken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of\\ngoblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword is the price of my hire,\\ntake it or leave it!”\\nGriphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, “We\\nneed to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could you give us a few\\nminutes?”\\nThe goblin nodded, looking sour.\\nDownstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow\\nfurrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, “He’s having a\\nlaugh. We can’t let him have that sword.”\\n“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword stolen by Gry-\\nffindor?”\\n“I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often skates over\\nwhat the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s no account\\nthat I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n440\\n“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the wizards\\nare always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think our-\\nselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.”\\n“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,” said Hermione.\\n“They’ve been treated brutally in the past.”\\n“Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?” said Ron.\\n“They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.”\\n“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and\\nviolent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?”\\nThere was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem.\\nHarry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna was arranging sea\\nlavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.\\n“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s this? We\\ntell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he\\ncan have it. There’s a fake in there, isn’t there? We switch them, and give\\nhim the fake.”\\n“Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said Hermione.\\n“He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!”\\n“Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes –”\\nHe quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.\\n“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-\\ncross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards, Ron?”\\nRon’s ears had turned red.\\n“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s your\\nsolution, then?”\\n“We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.”\\n“Brilliant. I’ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords\\nand you can gift wrap it.”\\nSilence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would\\naccept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to\\noffer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n441\\nHorcruxes.\\nHe closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the\\nsea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant\\nto him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been\\nthe champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pure-\\nbloodloving Slytherin...\\n“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Griphook.\\nMaybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the goblin ver-\\nsion of history’s right?”\\n“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione. “Changes how I feel about\\nit,” said Harry.\\nHe took a deep breath.\\n“We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get into that\\nvault – but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have\\nit.”\\nA grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, however, looked\\nalarmed.\\n“Harry, we can’t –”\\n“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of the Hor-\\ncruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.”\\n“But that could be years!” said Hermione.\\n“I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying really.”\\nHarry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remem-\\nbered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard:\\nFOR THE GREATER GOOD. He pushed the idea away. What choice did\\nthey have? “I don’t like it,” said Hermione.\\n“Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted.\\n“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s go and tell\\nhim.”\\nBack in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it\\nso as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n442\\nfrowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid\\nthat she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for\\nnobody but Harry.\\n“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of\\nGryffindor if I help you?”\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand.\\nHarry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any\\nmisgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands\\ntogether, and said, “So. We begin!”\\nIt was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled\\nto work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook’s\\npreference, in semidarkness.\\n“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” Griphook told them, “on\\nthe occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the\\nmost ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures\\nat the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected…”\\nThey remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly\\nthe days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to over-\\ncome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly\\ndepleted.\\n“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione, tilting the\\nthick mudlike potion against the lamplight.\\n“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s hand-\\ndrawn map of the deepest passageways.\\nThe other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that\\nsomething was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged\\nfor mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill’s\\neyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned.\\nThe longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not\\nmuch like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n443\\nthe idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to relish the possibility that\\nthey might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry\\ncould tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not\\ndiscuss it: They needed Griphook.\\nThe goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs\\nhad mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the\\nstillfrail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went\\nupstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter\\nGriphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat\\nthe same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various\\nfungi.\\nHarry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin\\nremain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the\\nwhole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George,\\nand Mr. Weasley could no longer work.\\n“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her\\nprepare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.”\\nShe had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for Griphook\\nand Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked\\nby Greyback. While the knives sliced away behind her, her somewhat\\nirritable expression softened.\\n“‘Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.”\\nThis was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding\\nher that Gabrielle had never been in real danger.\\n“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the\\nstove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel’s\\nzis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at\\nthe mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can\\ntake zat room.”\\n“We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said Harry, who knew that\\nGriphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n444\\nGriphook happy was essential to their plans. “Don’t worry about us.” And\\nwhen she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off your hands soon too,\\nRon, Hermione, and I. We won’t need to be here much longer.”\\n“But what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing\\nat the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course you must not\\nleave, you are safe ‘ere!”\\nShe looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that\\nthe back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair\\ndamp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood.\\n“...and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like a hippo’s, Daddy\\nsays, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum;\\nthey prefer a waltz, nothing too fast…”\\nLooking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following\\nLuna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione\\nwere laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape Fleur’s questions,\\nHarry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them.\\n“...and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn,\\nDaddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, because the Death\\nEaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for\\nChristmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire.\\n“Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. “That horn exploded.\\nIt came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack –”\\n“No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely. “Daddy told\\nme. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you\\nknow.”\\nHermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill\\nappeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still\\nlooked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported\\nhim, carrying a large suitcase.\\n“I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, approaching the old\\nman.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n445\\n“And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. “You\\nwere an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.”\\n“So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks.\\n“And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to\\nBill’s Auntie Muriel? I never returned ‘er tiara.”\\n“It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the very least I\\ncan do in return for your generous hospitality.”\\nFleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wand-\\nmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the lowhang-\\ning lamp.\\n“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled into the\\nroom without Harry noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?”\\n“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a\\nlook that was both furtive and challenging.\\nA strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander\\nset off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow\\nto elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire\\ncrackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was\\nmerely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes;\\nhowever, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long\\nhair tangled by the wind.\\n“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad\\nsay hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George are driving Muriel\\nup the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back\\nroom. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought\\nwe’d stolen it.”\\n“Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur crossly, waving her wand\\nand causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught\\nthem and marched out of the room.\\n“Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna. “Well, more of a crown, really.”\\nRon caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remember-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n446\\ning the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.\\n“Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks\\nhe’s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings\\nreally made a difference –”\\nThere was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head turned toward it.\\nFleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to\\nhis feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the\\nsame. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight.\\n“Who is it?” Bill called.\\n“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the howling wind. Harry\\nexperienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? “I am a werewolf, married\\nto Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told\\nme the address and bade me come in an emergency!”\\n“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open.\\nLupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling\\ncloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the\\nroom, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve\\nnamed him Ted, after Dora’s father!”\\nHermione shrieked.\\n“Wha –? Tonks – Tonks has had the baby?”\\n“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All around the table came\\ncries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, “Congra-\\ntulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if he had never heard of such\\na thing before.\\n“Yes – yes – a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own\\nhappiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the\\nbasement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened.\\n“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry. “M-me?” stammered\\nHarry.\\n“You, yes, of course – Dora quite agrees, no one better –”\\n“I – yeah – blimey –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n447\\nHarry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to\\nfetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.\\n“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around at them\\nall: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. “Thank you,\\nthank you, Bill.”\\nBill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high\\nin a toast.\\n“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard in the making!”\\n“‘Oo does ‘e look like?” Fleur inquired.\\n“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair.\\nIt looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour\\nsince. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks’s\\nhair started changing color the day that she was born.” He drained his\\ngoblet. “Oh, go on then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made to\\nfill it again.\\nThe wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and\\nBill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin’s news seemed to have\\ntaken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of\\nsiege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed\\nuntouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk\\nback to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only\\none who had noticed this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up\\nthe stairs.\\n“No... no... I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declining yet ano-\\nther goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back\\naround himself.\\n“Good-bye, good-bye – I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few days’\\ntime – they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you –”\\nHe fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and\\ngrasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild\\nnight. “Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the kitchen toge-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n448\\nther, helping clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!”\\nAs Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the\\ndoor behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others,\\nwho were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence.\\n“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to get an\\nopportunity with the cottage this full of people.”\\nBill hesitated.\\n“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.”\\nIt was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He\\nmerely looked at Bill, waiting.\\n“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left\\nHogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I\\nhave goblin friends – or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.” Again, Bill\\nhesitated.\\n“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised\\nhim in return?”\\n“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.”\\nThe kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through\\nmore empty goblets.\\n“Wait,” Bill told her. “Just a moment.”\\nShe backed out and he closed the door again.\\n“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any kind of\\nbargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves trea-\\nsure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership,\\npayment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.”\\nHarry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had\\nstirred inside him.\\n“What do you mean?” he asked.\\n“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill. “Dealings\\nbetween wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries – but you’ll\\nknow all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n449\\nwould never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a\\nbelief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone\\nto it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they\\nhave no respect for goblin ownership.”\\n“I respect –” Harry began, but Bill shook his head.\\n“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have\\nlived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is\\nthe maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects are, in goblin eyes,\\nrightfully theirs.”\\n“But if it was bought –”\\n“– then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money.\\nThey have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects\\npassing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when the tiara\\npassed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest\\nof his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the ori-\\nginal purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made\\nobjects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little\\nmore than theft.”\\nHarry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed\\nmore than he was letting on.\\n“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the\\nsitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It\\nwould be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise\\nto a goblin.”\\n“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll bear that\\nin mind.”\\nAs he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born\\nno doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just\\nas reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n450\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\\nGRINGOTTS\\nT\\nheir plans were made, their preparations complete; in the smallest bed-\\nroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione\\nhad been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the\\nmantelpiece.\\n“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, nodding toward the\\nwalnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.”\\nHermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her as she\\npicked it up.\\n“I hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It feels all\\nwrong, it doesn’t work properly for me It’s like a bit of her.”\\nHarry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his\\nloathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things\\nwhen it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice. He\\nchose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their\\nattempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize\\nher.\\n“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said Ron. “Think what\\nthat wand’s done!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n451\\n“But that’s my point!” said Hermione. “This is the wand that tortured\\nNeville’s mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is\\nthe wand that killed Sirius!”\\nHarry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was\\nvisited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor’s sword,\\nwhich was propped against the wall beside him.\\n“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Ollivander\\ncould have made me another one too.”\\nMr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on\\nthe back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon\\nsun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather\\ngloomily.\\nHarry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to\\nDraco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it\\nworked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had done. Remembering what\\nOllivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he\\nknew what Hermione’s problem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s\\nallegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix.\\nThe door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached\\ninstinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted\\nhis action at once: He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss\\nover the sticky moment, he said, “We’ve just been checking the last-minute\\nstuff, Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and\\nwe’ve told them not to get up to see us off.”\\nThey had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to\\ntransform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur\\nknew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better. They had\\nalso explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkins’s\\nold tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them\\nanother one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was\\nimpressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the sim-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n452\\nple expedient of stuffing it down her sock.\\nThough he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the\\nhome comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking\\nforward to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying\\nto make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny,\\ndark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, pre-\\ncisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over\\nGryffindor’s sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It\\nhad been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the\\ngoblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than\\nfive minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,” growled Ron,\\nas the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With\\nBill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was\\non the watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily\\nof the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to pick her\\nbrains on how best to do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been\\nable to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing\\nbetter than “We’ll just have to wing it, mate.”\\nHarry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours, he thought\\nback to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry\\nof Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he\\nwas experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: He could not shake off\\nthe fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their\\nplan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were\\nwellprepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still\\nhe felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was\\nawake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not\\nspeak.\\nIt was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of their\\nsleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden,\\nwhere they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n453\\nthere was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at the stars still\\nglimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward\\nand forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound.\\nSmall green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of\\nDobby’s grave now; in a year’s time the mound would be covered in flo-\\nwers. The white stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a wea-\\nthered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest\\nin a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving\\nhim behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf\\nhad known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absent-\\nmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which he\\ncould feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen\\nDumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made him look\\naround.\\nBellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accom-\\npanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag\\ninto the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from\\nGrimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really\\nHermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he\\nwas, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes\\ndisdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard\\nHermione through Bellatrix’s low voice.\\n“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so\\nI can do you…”\\n“Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long –”\\n“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome –”\\n“It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and\\ndo it the way you did last time.”\\nHermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she\\ntransformed various aspects of Ron’s appearance. He was to be given a\\ncompletely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n454\\nby Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be\\nconcealed under the Invisibility Cloak.\\n“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”\\nIt was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry\\nthought, because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now long and wavy;\\nhe had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose,\\nand heavy eyebrows.\\n“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we go, then?”\\nAll three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent\\nunder the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just\\nbeyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and\\nthey would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke.\\n“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?”\\nHarry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked\\nin front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling\\nof the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione\\npulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them\\nboth.\\n“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I can’t see a\\nthing. Let’s go.”\\nHarry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating\\nwith all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to\\nDiagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the com-\\npressing darkness, and seconds later Harry’s feet found pavement and he\\nopened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the\\nhangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s\\nexistence.\\nThe bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped\\nand toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a\\ncouple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced\\nat Hermione and drew back into the shadows.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n455\\n“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclin-\\ned his head subserviently.\\n“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying\\nGriphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.\\n“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of\\nthe inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”\\n“Okay, okay!”\\nHermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript\\nwall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole\\nappeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally form-\\ning an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.\\nIt was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any\\nshoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from\\nthe bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so\\nmany years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several\\nnew establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his\\nlast visit. Harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over\\nmany windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUM-\\nBER ONE.\\nA number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them\\nmoaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were\\nreally wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye.\\nAs they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They\\nseemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing\\nas fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man\\nwith the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.\\n“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked,\\nhighpitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he\\ndone with them? You know, you know!”\\n“I – I really –” stammered Hermione.\\nThe man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n456\\nburst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious.\\nRon stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible\\nbehind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street,\\nwhile a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes\\nabout them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.\\nTheir entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more con-\\nspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to\\nleave now and try to think of a different plan. Before they could move or\\nconsult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.\\n“Why, Madam Lestrange!”\\nHarry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry’s\\nneck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp\\nnose was striding toward them.\\n“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that moment\\nHarry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to\\nher fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster:\\n“And what do you want?”\\nTravers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.\\n“He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled side-\\nways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear.\\n“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my presence\\nis not welcome...”\\nHarry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters\\nwho had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.\\n“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up\\nher mistake. “How are you?”\\n“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.”\\n“Really? Why?” asked Hermione.\\n“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor\\nwere confined to the house, after the... ah... escape.”\\nHarry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n457\\nwas not supposed to be out in public –\\n“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in\\nthe past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most\\ncontemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine\\nis, Travers.”\\nThough the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious.\\nHe glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned. “How did it offend\\nyou?”\\n“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione coolly.\\n“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said Travers. “While they\\ndo nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me\\nto plead her case at the Ministry last week. ‘I’m a witch, sir, I’m a witch, let\\nme prove it to you!’” he said in a squeaky impersonation. “As if I was going\\nto give her my wand – but whose wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you\\nusing at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was –”\\n“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix’s\\nwand. “I don’t know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but\\nyou seem sadly misinformed.”\\nTravers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron.\\n“Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.”\\n“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had decided that a\\nfictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. “He speaks very\\nlittle English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has\\ntraveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.”\\n“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?”\\n“‘Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand.\\nTravers extended two fingers and shook Ron’s hand as though frightened\\nof dirtying himself.\\n“So what brings you and your – ah – sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley\\nthis early?” asked Travers.\\n“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n458\\n“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without\\nit, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered\\nfriends.”\\nHarry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his\\nneck. “Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.\\nHermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along\\nthe crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Grin-\\ngotts stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside\\nthem, and Harry and Griphook followed.\\nA watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst\\nof it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side,\\nthere was no means for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All\\ntoo soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great\\nbronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins\\nwho usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both\\nof whom were clutching long thin golden rods.\\n“Ah, Probity Probes,” sighed Travers theatrically, “so crude – but effect-\\nive!”\\nAnd he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who\\nraised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes,\\nHarry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects.\\nKnowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco’s wand at each of\\nthe guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by Travers,\\nwho was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the\\nguards gave a little start as the spells hit them.\\nHermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps.\\n“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe.\\n“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in Bellatrix’s commanding,\\narrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was\\nconfused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his\\ncompanion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, “Yeah, you’ve just checked\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n459\\nthem, Marius.”\\nHermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting\\ninvisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold:\\nThe wizards were both scratching their heads.\\nTwo goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and\\nwhich carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves.\\nHarry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to\\nhim: standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, the\\nmost wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying,\\n“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place\\nof wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never\\nknown he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that\\nhe would return to steal... But within seconds they were standing in the vast\\nmarble hall of the bank.\\nThe long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving\\nthe first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward\\nan old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass.\\nHermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining\\nfeatures of the hall to Ron.\\nThe goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in parti-\\ncular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny\\ngolden key, which was examined and given back to him.\\nHermione stepped forward.\\n“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled. “Dear me! How\\n– how may I help you today?”\\n“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione.\\nThe old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only\\nwas Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked\\nup from their work to stare at Hermione.\\n“You have... identification?” asked the goblin.\\n“Identification? I – I have never been asked for identification before!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n460\\nsaid Hermione.\\n“They know!” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear. “They must have been\\nwarned there might be an impostor!”\\n“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held out a slightly\\ntrembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the\\ngoblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen.\\n“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the Imperius\\nCurse!”\\nHarry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old\\ngoblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, “Imperio!”\\nA curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth\\nthat seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting\\nhim to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix’s\\nwand, examined it closely, and then said, “Ah, you have had a new wand\\nmade, Madam Lestrange!”\\n“What?” said Hermione. “No, no, that’s mine –”\\n“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the\\ngoblins all around were watching. “But how could you have done, which\\nwandmaker did you use?”\\nHarry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered,\\n“Imperio!” once more.\\n“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand, “yes,\\nvery handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little\\nbreaking in, don’t you?”\\nHermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous relief she\\naccepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.\\nThe old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin\\napproached.\\n“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away and\\nreturned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling\\nmetal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! So, if you will follow\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n461\\nme, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and\\nvanishing from sight, “I shall take you to your vault.”\\nHe appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them,\\nthe contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite\\nstill with his mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this\\nodd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion.\\n“Wait – Bogrod!”\\nAnother goblin came scurrying around the counter.\\n“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. “Forgive me,\\nMadam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lest-\\nrange.”\\nHe whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook\\nhim off.\\n“I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her\\nvault... Very old family... old clients... This way, please...”\\nAnd, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off\\nthe hall. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot\\nlooking abnormally vacant, and made his decision: With a flick of his wand\\nhe made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they\\nreached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which\\nwas lit with flaming torches.\\n“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door slammed behind\\nthem and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from\\nhis shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at\\nthe sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,”\\nhe added, in response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about\\nTravers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. “I\\ndon’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know…”\\nAnd another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix\\nLestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable\\nCurse: “You need to mean them, Potter!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n462\\n“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, while we can?”\\n“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main\\nhall, beyond which who knew what was happening.\\n“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry.\\n“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no\\nlonger have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.”\\nHarry pointed his wand at Travers.\\n“Imperio!”\\nThe wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. “What\\nare you making him do?”\\n“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to\\nsummon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out\\nof the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the\\nmain hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook,\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back.\\nWith a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled past Tra-\\nvers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting\\nand turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the\\ntime. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the\\ntracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying\\never deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well\\nhave left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it,\\nthe more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have\\nbrought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had\\nstolen it –\\nThey were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they\\ntook a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare,\\na waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but\\nthere was no braking: They zoomed through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes\\nand mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart\\nflipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n463\\ninto pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and\\nfelt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing\\npainlessly on the rocky passage floor.\\n“C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her\\nfeet, but to Harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead\\nshe stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron\\nwas red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they looked at\\neach other, feeling their own faces.\\n“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet and look-\\ning back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been\\nmore than water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical conceal-\\nment! They know there are impostors in Gringotts, they have set off defen-\\nses against us!” Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded\\nbag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had\\nnot lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his\\nhead in bewilderment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed to have lifted the\\nImperius Curse.\\n“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the vault without a\\nGringotts goblin. And we need the Clankers!”\\n“Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage\\nas he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand.\\nBogrod submitted once more to his will, his befuddled expression changing\\nto one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of\\nmetal tools.\\n“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and she point-\\ned Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!” They saw the\\nShield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passage-\\nway.\\n“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!”\\n“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried on foot\\ninto the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n464\\ndog.\\n“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. He was trying to\\nlisten: He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around\\nnearby. “Griphook, how much farther?”\\n“Not far, Harry Potter, not far...”\\nAnd they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been\\nprepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.\\nA gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring\\naccess to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast’s scales\\nhad turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground; its\\neyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains\\nled to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked\\nwings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread\\nthem, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise\\nthat made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent\\nthem running back up the passageway.\\n“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even more savage for that.\\nHowever, we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect\\nwhen the Clankers come. Give them to me.”\\nRon passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of\\nsmall metal instruments that when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like\\nminiature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted\\nhis meekly.\\n“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “It\\nwill expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must\\nplace his palm upon the door of the vault.”\\nThey advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the\\nnoise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of\\nHarry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. The dragon let out another\\nhoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew\\nnearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n465\\nthat it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the\\nClankers.\\n“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who\\nturned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his\\npalm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike\\nopening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver\\narmor, the skins of strange creatures – some with long spines, others with\\ndrooping wings – potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a\\ncrown.\\n“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault.\\nHe had described Hufflepuff’s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the\\nother, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it\\nlooked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was\\na muffled clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them\\ninside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness.\\n“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook as Ron\\ngave a shout of surprise. “Light your wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have\\nvery little time!”\\n“Lumos!”\\nHarry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon glittering\\njewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst\\na jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were\\nnow examining the piles of objects surrounding them.\\n“Harry, could this be –? Aargh!”\\nHermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to\\nsee a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a\\nshower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was\\ncovered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible\\nto discern amongst them.\\n“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.\\n“They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook. “Eve-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n466\\nrything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless – and\\nif you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to\\ndeath by the weight of expanding gold!”\\n“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even as he said\\nit, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and\\ntwenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his\\nshoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.\\n“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron.\\n“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small and gold,\\nit’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles – otherwise see if you can spot\\nRavenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle –”\\nThey directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously\\non the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent\\na great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the gob-\\nlets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing\\ngold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wandlight\\npassed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the\\nceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an\\nobject that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.\\n“It’s there, it’s up there!”\\nRon and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so that the little golden\\ncup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga\\nHufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from\\nwhom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.\\n“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching any-\\nthing?” asked Ron.\\n“Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her des-\\nperation what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions.\\n“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin.\\n“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If you want\\nthe sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than – wait! Can I\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n467\\ntouch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!”\\nHermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the beaded bag, rummaged\\nfor a few seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its\\nrubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which\\ndid not multiply.\\n“If I can just poke the sword through a handle – but how am I going to\\nget up there?”\\nThe shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them,\\neven Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in\\nwaves, and sweat ran down Harry’s face and back as he struggled to think\\nof a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side\\nof the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.\\nThey were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the\\ndoor, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side.\\nHarry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces.\\n“Hermione,” said Harry as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to get up\\nthere, we’ve got to get rid of it –”\\nShe raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, “Levicorpus.”\\nHoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas\\nburst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams\\nof pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other\\nobjects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot\\ntreasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the\\nhandle of Hufflepuff’s cup, hooking it onto the blade.\\n“Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron,\\nand the goblins from the burning metal.\\nThen the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione\\nwere waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping\\nbeneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but\\nthe tips of a few long fingers were left in view.\\nHarry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emer-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n468\\nged by degrees, howling.\\n“Liberacorpus!” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed\\non the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry’s\\nhand.\\n“Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as\\nGriphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the\\nswelling mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword? It had the cup on it!”\\nThe clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening – it\\nwas too late –\\n“There!”\\nIt was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that\\ninstant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their\\nword. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry’s hair, to make sure he\\ndid not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of\\nthe sword and swung it high out of Harry’s reach.\\nThe tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword’s blade, was\\nflung into the air. The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and caught it,\\nand although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even\\nwhile countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him\\nas the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding\\nuncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore\\nhim, Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber.\\nHardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne\\nalong on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his\\npocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding\\nfrom Harry’s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover\\namongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thie-\\nves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!” He vanished into the midst of the advancing\\ncrowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without\\nquestion.\\nSlipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n469\\nonly way out was through.\\n“Stupefy!” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red\\nlight flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others\\nadvanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner.\\nThe tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the gob-\\nlins: The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspi-\\nration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs\\nchaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, “Relashio!”\\nThe cuffs broke open with loud bangs.\\n“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advan-\\ncing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon.\\n“Harry – Harry – what are you doing?” cried Hermione. “Get up, climb\\nup, come on –”\\nThe dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s foot found the crook\\nof its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard\\nas steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione\\nhoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second later the\\ndragon became aware that it was untethered.\\nWith a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he\\ncould to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking gob-\\nlins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione,\\nflat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage\\nopening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its\\nflanks.\\n“We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but the dragon\\nopened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors\\nand ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force the dragon clawed and\\nfought its way through. Harry’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and\\ndust: Deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only\\ncling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard\\nHermione yelling, “Defodio!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n470\\nShe was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceil-\\ning as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking\\nand clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart\\nwith more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great\\ncrawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and\\nbehind them the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of\\ngreat lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the\\ngoblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon’s fire\\nkept their progress clear –\\nAnd then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon’s\\nbrute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble\\nhallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the\\ndragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the\\ncool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through\\nthe metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it\\nstaggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n471\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\\nTHE FINAL HIDING PLACE\\nT\\nhere was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was\\ngoing, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they\\nwould find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they\\nclimbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a grayand-\\ngreen map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape\\nthat had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck, he clung\\ntight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned\\nand blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a\\nwindmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron\\nkept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.\\nAfter five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the\\ndragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but\\ngetting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question\\nof how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He\\nhad no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this parti-\\ncular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put\\ndown. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar\\nprickling...\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n472\\nHow long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into\\nthe Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify\\nBellatrix? How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then,\\nwhen they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would\\nknow, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes...\\nThe dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It climbed steadily\\nuntil they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no\\nlonger make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out\\nof the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in patches\\nof green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape\\nlike strips of matte and glossy ribbon.\\n“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew farther\\nand farther north.\\n“No idea,” Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb with cold but he\\ndid not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time\\nwhat they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon\\nheaded for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately\\nhungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten?\\nSurely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it\\nrealized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?\\nThe sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the\\ndragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enorm-\\nous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. Every part of\\nHarry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back.\\n“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of\\nsilence, “or are we losing height?”\\nHarry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in\\nthe sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he\\nsquinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divin-\\ned the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.\\nLower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n473\\nseemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.\\n“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to the others.\\n“Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!”\\nThey agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the\\ndragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.\\n“NOW!”\\nHe slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward\\nthe surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he\\nhit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled\\nworld. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous\\nripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had\\nfallen.\\nThe dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: It was already fifty\\nfeet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout.\\nAs Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of\\nthe lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a\\ndistant bank.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did\\nnot seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way\\nthrough reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden,\\npanting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.\\nHermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have\\nhappily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and\\nstarted casting the usual protective spells around them.\\nWhen he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he\\nhad seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red\\nburns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in\\nplaces. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their\\nmany injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three\\nbottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry\\nrobes for all of them. They changed and then gulped down the juice.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n474\\n“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin\\non his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the downside –”\\n“– no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany\\nthrough the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.\\n“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little scab...”\\nHarry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just\\ntaken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun,\\nit drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.\\n“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging round\\nour necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.\\nHermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was\\nstill drinking.\\n“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all right?”\\n“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look\\nafter itself. It’s us we need to worry about.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they\\nmight have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”\\nAll three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to\\nstop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on\\nthe grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.\\n“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping\\nherself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who will\\nknow we know about his Horcruxes!”\\n“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said Ron hopefully. “Maybe\\nthey’ll cover up –”\\nThe sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were exting-\\nuished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was standing in\\na dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor at\\nhis feet knelt a small, quaking figure.\\n“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n475\\nburned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded – but it could not be true,\\nhe could not see how...\\nThe goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his.\\n“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!”\\n“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror,\\n“mmy Lord... we t-tried t-to st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke\\n– broke into the – into the Lestranges’ v-vault…”\\n“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing\\nimpostors? Who were they?”\\n“It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and t-two accomplices…”\\n“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him.\\n“Tell me! What did they take?”\\n“A... a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord…”\\nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s: He was\\ncrazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had ever\\nknown: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?\\nThe Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through\\nthe room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards\\nscattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others\\nbehind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell,\\nand those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news,\\nfor hearing about the golden cup –\\nAlone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they passed before\\nhim in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality – the\\ndiary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the boy knew\\nabout the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more\\nof them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always\\nsuspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand\\nwas his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the\\nboy, the boy –\\nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Volde-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n476\\nmort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them\\nall; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many\\nother worthless, nameless men: How could Lord Voldemort not have\\nknown, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked,\\nmutilated?\\nTrue, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had\\nthought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than ghost... No,\\nsurely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes must be intact...\\nBut he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside\\nthe goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his\\nboiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts –\\nA modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that\\nhe had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to\\nbe related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had\\nnever been traced to him: The ring, surely, was safe.\\nAnd how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or pene-\\ntrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd...\\nAs for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the\\nHorcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place...\\nAnd there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent\\nto do his bidding, under his protection...\\nBut to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding\\nplaces, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job,\\nlike the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone...\\nWhich should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease\\nflickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name...\\nDumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts Their\\nabandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was\\nthere that he would go first...\\nThe lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility that\\nDumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n477\\norphanage.\\nAnd Hogwarts but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be\\nimpossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the\\nschool. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the\\nboy might try to reenter the castle To tell Snape why the boy might return\\nwould be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix\\nand Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was\\never to trust?\\nHe would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him: He\\nwould not be parted from the snake anymore... and he strode from the room,\\nthrough the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he\\ncalled the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long\\nshadow...\\nHarry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: He\\nwas lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione\\nwere looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the conti-\\nnued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort’s mind had\\nnot passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he\\nwas still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before\\nhim, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun.\\n“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort’s\\nhigh screams. “He knows, and he’s going to check where the others are, and\\nthe last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew\\nit.”\\n“What?”\\nRon was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. “But what did\\nyou see? How do you know?”\\n“I saw him find out about the cup, I – I was in his head, he’s” – Harry\\nremembered the killings – “he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t\\nunderstand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe,\\nthe ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n478\\nbecause it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one\\nlast, but he could still be there within hours –”\\n“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to his\\nfeet too.\\n“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about\\nexactly where it is –”\\n“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and Harry\\npulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a\\nplan, we need to –”\\n“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep,\\nlooking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now.\\n“Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the\\nlocket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t\\nsafe enough?”\\n“But how are we going to get in?”\\n“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out\\nonce we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the\\nCloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.”\\n“But we don’t really fit –”\\n“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”\\nThe flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: The\\ndragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their prepa-\\nrations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly\\ndarkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione\\nwalked forward and took her place between the other two. Harry pulled the\\nCloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into\\nthe crushing darkness.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n479\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\\nTHE MISSING MIRROR\\nH\\narry’s feet touched road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade\\nHigh Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond\\nthe village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts,\\nand light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a\\nlurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had land-\\ned here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore;\\nall this in a second, upon landing – and then, even as he relaxed his grip\\nupon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.\\nThe air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he had\\nrealized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and\\nhe knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked\\nat the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst\\nopen and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street,\\ntheir wands aloft.\\nHarry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of\\nthem to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their position. One of the\\nDeath Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around\\nthe distant mountains.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n480\\n“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters.\\nHarry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning\\nCharm had not worked on it.\\n“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater who had\\ntried the charm, and then to his fellows, “Spread out. He’s here.”\\nSix of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nbacked as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death\\nEaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the\\nfootsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from\\nthe Death Eaters’ searching wands.\\n“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”\\n“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a Death Eater shou-\\nted, “We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find\\nyou!”\\n“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that spell to tell\\nthem we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap\\nus–”\\n“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ‘em have free\\nrein, they’d find him quick enough!”\\n“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his –”\\n“– an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not\\nhis soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”\\nThere were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors\\nthey would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away\\nimmediately.\\n“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.\\nEven as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street.\\nLight was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which\\nvanished.\\nIn the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and toge-\\nther, they turned on the spot.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n481\\nThe air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid:\\nThey could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well.\\nThe cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh. He, Ron, and\\nHermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall,\\ntrying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly,\\ncame dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser\\ndarkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed\\nand rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of\\nit: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging,\\nrattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in –\\nHe raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer the Dementor’s Kiss,\\nwhatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought\\nas he whispered, “Expecto Patronum!”\\nThe silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors scattered\\nand there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.\\n“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!”\\nThe dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the\\nfootsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his\\npanic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door\\nopened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said,\\n“Potter, in here, quick!”\\nHe obeyed without hesitation: The three of them hurtled through the open\\ndoorway.\\n“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure, passing\\nthem on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him.\\nHarry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering\\nlight of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of the Hog’s Head\\nInn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led\\nto a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could. The\\nstairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small\\nfireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n482\\ngazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness.\\nShouts reached them from the street below. Still wearing the Invisibility\\nCloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior,\\nwhom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman, was the only\\nperson not wearing a hood.\\n“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what?\\nYou send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at ‘em! I’m\\nnot having ‘em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!”\\n“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater. “That was a stag, it was\\nPotter’s!”\\n“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You idiot –\\nExpecto Patronum!”\\nSomething huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head down, it\\ncharged toward the High Street and out of sight.\\n“That’s not what I saw –” said the Death Eater, though with less certainty.\\n“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told\\nthe barman. “Someone was out in the street against regulations –”\\n“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!”\\n“You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”\\n“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my\\nnose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your\\nsakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him. He’s\\nnot going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now?”\\n“Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry about\\nyourself, breaking curfew!”\\n“And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s\\nclosed down? What’ll happen to your little sidelines then?”\\n“Are you threatening –?”\\n“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?”\\n“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death Eater. “Stag?”\\nroared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n483\\n“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater. “Break cur-\\nfew again and we won’t be so lenient!”\\nThe Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermione moaned\\nwith relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-\\nlegged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the Cloak off\\nhimself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the\\ndoor of the bar, then climbing the stairs.\\nHarry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small,\\nrectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.\\nThe barman entered the room.\\n“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of\\nthem. “What were you thinking, coming here?”\\n“Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you enough. You saved our\\nlives.”\\nThe barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the face,\\ntrying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard. He wore\\nspectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.\\n“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”\\nThere was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each\\nother. “You sent Dobby.”\\nThe barman nodded and looked around for the elf. “Thought he’d be with\\nyou. Where’ve you left him?”\\n“He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”\\nThe barman’s face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m\\nsorry to hear it. I liked that elf.”\\nHe turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at\\nany of them.\\n“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.\\nHe neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire.\\n“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror,\\nthe twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n484\\n“Bought it from Dung ‘bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me\\nwhat it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”\\nRon gasped.\\n“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?”\\n“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth. “Someone sent a doe Pat-\\nronus to us!”\\n“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just proved\\nmy Patronus is a goat?”\\n“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah... well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his\\nstomach gave an enormous rumble.\\n“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing\\nmoments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of\\nmead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they\\nate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the\\nfire, the clink of goblets, and the sound of chewing.\\n“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and Harry and\\nRon sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to think of the best way to\\nget you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard what happens if any-\\none moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll\\nbe onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to\\npass off a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts,\\nthen you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of\\nHogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to Disapparate there.\\nMight see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever\\nsince they tried to arrest him.”\\n“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.”\\n“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.\\n“We’ve got to,” said Harry.\\n“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to get as\\nfar from here as you can.”\\n“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n485\\ncastle. Dumbledore – I mean, your brother – wanted us –”\\nThe firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momentarily\\nopaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the\\ngiant spider, Aragog.\\n“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people\\nhad a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You\\nget away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget\\nmy brother and his clever schemes. He’s gone where none of this can hurt\\nhim, and you don’t owe him anything.”\\n“You don’t understand,” said Harry again.\\n“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I understood my\\nown brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?”\\n“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaust-\\nion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s... he left me a job.”\\n“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort\\nof thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without\\noverstretching themselves?”\\nRon gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. “I-it’s not\\neasy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to –”\\n“‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth roughly.\\n“Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!”\\n“I can’t.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“I –” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the\\noffensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order of the Phoe-\\nnix –”\\n“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-\\nKnow-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s\\nkidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you\\ntoo badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two\\nwith you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n486\\nlong as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.”\\n“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job –”\\n“Give it to someone else!”\\n“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all –”\\n“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with\\nyou?”\\nHarry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple\\nword would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was\\nthinking.\\n“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee.\\nSecrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural.”\\nThe old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantel-\\npiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the\\nroom. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.\\n“Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is that your sister?\\nAriana?”\\n“Yes,” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you,\\nmissy?”\\nEven by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned\\nred. “Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare\\nHermione. “That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of\\nmead. “Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice, he did.\\nWell, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.”\\nHarry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties\\nabout Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his\\nchoice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to continue along the\\nwinding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept\\nthat he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to\\ntrust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that\\nwould deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was\\nso strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same impre-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n487\\nssion that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought\\nthat Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it.\\n“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Hermione\\nin a low voice.\\n“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how many of the people\\nmy brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d\\nleft ‘em well alone.”\\n“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly. “Never you mind,”\\nsaid Aberforth.\\n“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are you – are\\nyou talking about your sister?”\\nAberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words\\nhe was holding back. Then he burst into speech.\\n“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three\\nMuggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden\\nhedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard can at that\\nage. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through\\nthe hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried\\naway trying to stop the little freak doing it.”\\nHermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick.\\nAberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the\\nintensity of his pain.\\n“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn’t\\nuse magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad,\\nit exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was\\nstrange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.\\n“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth, “and\\nattacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said\\nwhy he’d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had\\nbecome, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have\\nseen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unba-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n488\\nlanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she\\ncouldn’t keep it in any longer.\\n“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she\\nwas ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and\\nhappy.\\n“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed\\nto look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not Albus, he\\nwas always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and\\ncounting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most\\nnotable magical names of the day,’” Aberforth sneered. “He didn’t want to\\nbe bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she\\nwouldn’t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was\\nin one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the\\ngoats.\\n“Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn’t there,” said Aberforth. “If\\nI’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and\\nmy mother wasn’t as young as she was, and... it was an accident. Ariana\\ncouldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”\\nHarry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear\\nany more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had\\nbeen since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken\\nabout it.\\n“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The\\npair of ‘em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on\\nhis own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!”\\nAberforth spat into the fire.\\n“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d\\nhave stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and\\nhe’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there’s\\nno prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the\\nhouse every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks... till he came.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n489\\nAnd now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face. “Grin-\\ndelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as\\nbright and talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat\\nthen, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order,\\nand looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested\\nin. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl got\\nneglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater\\ngood?\\n“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for\\nme to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ‘em, both of ‘em, face-to-face, like I\\nam to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it took little\\nimagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder\\nbrother. “I told him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s\\nin no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to\\ngo, when you’re making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up\\na following. He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly\\noccluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone white and\\nblind again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me\\nwhat a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my\\nbrilliant brother... Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t have to be\\nhidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding,\\nand taught the Muggles their place?\\n“And there was an argument... and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled\\nout his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s best\\nfriend – and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were\\ndueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn’t stand\\nit –”\\nThe color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had suffered\\na mortal wound.\\n“– and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she\\nwas doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n490\\nus – and she was dead.”\\nHis voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest\\nchair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as\\nAberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it,\\nwished he could wash his mind clean of it.\\n“I’m so... I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered. “Gone,” croaked Aber-\\nforth. “Gone forever.”\\nHe wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.\\n“‘Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already,\\nback in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too.\\nAnd Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to\\nbecome the greatest wizard of the –”\\n“He was never free,” said Harry.\\n“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.\\n“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a potion\\nthat drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with some-\\none who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please... hurt me instead.’”\\nRon and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details\\nabout what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had\\ntaken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed\\nit so thoroughly.\\n“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,”\\nsaid Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. “He thought\\nhe was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana... It was torture to\\nhim, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free.”\\nAberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined\\nhands. After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure, Potter, that my\\nbrother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can\\nyou be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?”\\nA shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.\\n“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n491\\n“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth. “Why didn’t\\nhe say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’?”\\n“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes\\nyou’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve\\ngot to think about the greater good! This is war!”\\n“You’re seventeen, boy!”\\n“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!”\\n“Who says I’ve given up?”\\n“‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’” Harry repeated. “‘You-Know-\\nWho’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding\\nthemselves.’”\\n“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-\\nWho and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep going until\\nI succeed – or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve\\nknown it for years.”\\nHe waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely\\nscowled.\\n“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t help us,\\nwe’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in our-\\nselves. If you can help us – well, now would be a great time to mention it.”\\nAberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that\\nwere so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got\\nto his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of\\nAriana. “You know what to do,” he said.\\nShe smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually\\ndid, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long\\ntunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until\\nfinally she was swallowed by the darkness.\\n“Er – what –?” began Ron.\\n“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know they’ve\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n492\\ngot all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all\\naround the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my\\nsources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you\\nexpect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the\\nCarrows as his deputies... well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say you’re\\nprepared to die.”\\n“But what...?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture.\\nA tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now\\nAriana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she\\ncame. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she\\nwas, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than\\nHarry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his\\nface and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures\\ngrew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole\\nthing swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real\\ntunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes\\nripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight,\\nleapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I knew you’d come! I knew\\nit, Harry!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n493\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\\nTHE LOST DIADEM\\n“N\\neville – what the – how –?”\\nBut Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was\\nhugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appear-\\ned: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks\\non his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been\\nliving rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he\\nlet go of Hermione and said again, “I knew you’d come! Kept telling Sea-\\nmus it was a matter of time!”\\n“Neville, what’s happened to you?”\\n“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head.\\n“This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get going then?\\nOh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people on\\nthe way.”\\n“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you mean, a\\ncouple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on\\nthe whole village!”\\n“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” said\\nNeville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you?\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n494\\nThanks a lot.”\\nNeville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto\\nthe mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry\\naddressed Aberforth.\\n“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.”\\n“Look after ‘em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might not be able to\\nsave ‘em a third time.”\\nHarry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind\\nAriana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked\\nas though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from\\nthe walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their\\nshadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall.\\n“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It isn’t on the\\nMarauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in\\nand out of school?”\\n“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said Neville.\\n“There’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses\\nover the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” He\\nstarted walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that\\nstuff... Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon?\\nIt’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by\\nCarrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!”\\n“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry. Neville laughed gleefully.\\n“What did you do with the dragon?”\\n“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as\\na pet –”\\n“Don’t exaggerate, Ron –”\\n“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just\\nbeen on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to\\nsomething.”\\n“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n495\\nhaven’t heard anything.”\\n“It’s been... well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville,\\nthe smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the\\nCarrows?”\\n“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”\\n“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all\\ndiscipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”\\n“Like Umbridge?”\\n“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to\\nrefer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they\\ncan avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.\\n“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark\\nArts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the\\nCruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions –”\\n“What?”\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the\\npassage.\\n“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a parti-\\ncularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into it,\\nthough; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in\\nanything, I expect.\\n“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory\\nfor everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like\\nanimals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being\\nvicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got\\nthis one,” he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her how much\\nMuggle blood she and her brother have got.”\\n“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for getting a\\nsmart mouth.”\\n“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either.\\nThe thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n496\\nI used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”\\n“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing slightly\\nas they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater\\nrelief.\\nNeville shrugged.\\n“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll\\ntorture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.”\\nHarry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying\\nor the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.\\n“The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives\\non the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno\\nLovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged\\nLuna off the train on the way back for Christmas.”\\n“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her –”\\n“Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.”\\nFrom his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one\\nof the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another\\nmessages.\\n“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The Carr-\\nows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We\\nused to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore’s Army,\\nStill Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.”\\n“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.\\n“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost Luna\\nat Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us\\nwere sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of\\nit, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went\\nand got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured\\nhim pretty badly. That scared people off.”\\n“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward.\\n“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n497\\ndropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground\\nstuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they decided there\\nwas only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.”\\n“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\\n“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was\\nclimbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really\\nwell, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only\\na matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,” he\\nfaced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit\\noff a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone,\\nthey probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly\\npowerful. Anyway,” Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and\\nGran’s on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast\\npocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’\\nson, and to keep it up.”\\n“Cool,” said Ron.\\n“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized they\\nhad no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all.\\nI don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban;\\neither way, I knew it was time to disappear.”\\n“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t – aren’t we\\nheading straight back into Hogwarts?”\\n“‘Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.”\\nThey turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage.\\nAnother short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind\\nAriana’s portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry\\nfollowed, he heard Neville call out to unseen people:\\n“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”\\nAs Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several\\nscreams and yells:\\n“HARRY!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n498\\n“It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!”\\n“Ron!”\\n“Hermione!”\\nHe had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many\\nfaces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged,\\npounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed\\nto be more than twenty people: They might just have won a Quidditch final.\\n“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd backed away,\\nHarry was able to take in their surroundings.\\nHe did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and looked rather\\nlike the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic\\nship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from\\na balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls,\\nwhich were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gry-\\nffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set\\nagainst yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and\\ngreen of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few\\nbroomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-\\ncased wireless.\\n“Where are we?”\\n“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed itself,\\nhasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance\\nfor a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found!\\nWell, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there\\nwas only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it’s expanded as\\nmore and more of the D.A. have arrived.”\\n“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking around for the\\ndoor.\\n“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he\\nspoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long\\nas one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. It’s all\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n499\\ndown to Neville. He really gets this room. You’ve got to ask it for exactly\\nwhat you need – like, ‘I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get\\nin’ – and it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make sure you close the\\nloopholes! Neville’s the man!”\\n“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d been in\\nhere about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could\\nget something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the Hog’s Head opened\\nup. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food,\\nbecause for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.”\\n“Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Ele-\\nmental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.\\n“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Seamus, “and\\nit just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even\\nsprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up –”\\n“– and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender Brown,\\nwhom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around\\nproperly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as\\nwere Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael\\nCorner.\\n“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve been so\\nmany rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.” He\\npointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into Gringotts?”\\n“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!”\\nThere was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow.\\n“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.\\nBefore any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry\\nfelt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back\\nhastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement\\nvanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting\\nfloorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open\\nand empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n500\\nhis head.\\nWith an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind again, back\\nto where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring\\nfrom his face and Ron holding him up.\\n“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down? I\\nexpect you’re tired, aren’t –?”\\n“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them\\nwithout words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the\\nother Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit\\nHogwarts next, they would miss their chance.\\n“We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions told him that they\\nunderstood.\\n“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s the\\nplan?”\\n“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent\\nhimself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning.\\n“Well, there’s something we – Ron, Hermione, and I – need to do, and then\\nwe’ll get out of here.”\\nNobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused.\\n“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?”\\n“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to\\nsoothe the pain. “There’s something important we need to do –”\\n“What is it?”\\n“I – I can’t tell you.”\\nThere was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s brows contracted.\\n“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-\\nKnowWho, right?”\\n“Well, yeah –”\\n“Then we’ll help you.”\\nThe other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some en-\\nthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n501\\ndemonstrate their willingness for immediate action.\\n“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last\\nfew hours. “We – we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do it – alone.”\\n“Why?” asked Neville.\\n“Because...” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux,\\nor at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where\\nthey might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather his\\nthoughts. His scar was still searing. “Dumbledore left the three of us a job,”\\nhe said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell – I mean, he wanted us\\nto do it, just the three of us.”\\n“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were all in it\\ntogether, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your\\nown –”\\n“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron.\\n“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Everyone in\\nthis room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because the\\nCarrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal\\nto Dumbledore – loyal to you.”\\n“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it\\ndid not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind him.\\n“We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be\\nhere!”\\nIt was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug\\nhis best friend.\\n“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!”\\n“Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing here? How did\\nyou –?”\\n“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I promised\\nher and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We all thought that\\nif you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to over-\\nthrow Snape and the Carrows.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n502\\n“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly. “Isn’t it, Harry?\\nWe’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?”\\n“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but that’s\\nnot what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then–”\\n“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael Corner.\\n“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s\\nall about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who –”\\n“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part of it!”\\nThere was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed\\nto fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely\\nfollowed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant\\nsmile: He had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she\\nwas, but he had never been less pleased to see her.\\n“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer\\nto several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a rail-\\nway station.”\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old girl-\\nfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.\\n“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she\\nwalked over to sit beside Michael Corner.\\n“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George.\\n“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance\\nof all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burn-\\ning so fiercely.\\n“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,” said\\nFred.\\n“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you call them\\nall back for? This is insane –”\\n“We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. “The\\nmessage said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I’ll have to get a\\nwand, though –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n503\\n“You haven’t got a wand –?” began Seamus. Ron turned suddenly to\\nHarry.\\n“Why can’t they help?”\\n“What?”\\n“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them\\ncould hear but Hermione, who stood between them, “We don’t know where\\nit is. We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux.”\\nHarry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think Ron’s\\nright. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them.” And\\nwhen Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone,\\nHarry.”\\nHarry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split\\nagain. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and\\nHermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up,\\nand Albus... he was a natural Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his\\nsecrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted\\nSnape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower...\\n“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called to the room\\nat large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes\\nfor the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert,\\nexcited.\\n“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. “Something – some-\\nthing that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts, but\\nwe don’t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone\\nheard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with\\nher eagle on it, for instance?”\\nHe looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma,\\nMichael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the\\narm of Ginny’s chair.\\n“Well, there’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The\\nlost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n504\\n“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, “is\\nlost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.”\\n“When was it lost?” asked Harry.\\n“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Professor\\nFlitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have\\nlooked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever found\\na trace of it, have they?”\\nThey all shook their heads.\\n“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron.\\n“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed to\\nhave magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.”\\n“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons –” But Harry cut across Luna.\\n“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?”\\nThey all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and\\nhis own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been\\nlost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candi-\\ndate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle... Before he could formulate a new\\nquestion, however, Cho spoke again.\\n“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, I could take\\nyou up to our common room and show you, Harry? Ravenclaw’s wearing it\\nin her statue.”\\nHarry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement\\nswam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him\\nand felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was fly-\\ning again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not\\nknow: Either way, there was hardly any time left.\\n“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at\\nCho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m\\ngoing to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks\\nlike. Wait for me here and keep, you know – the other one – safe.”\\nCho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, “No, Luna will\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n505\\ntake Harry, won’t you, Luna?”\\n“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again, look-\\ning disappointed.\\n“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville. “Over here.”\\nHe led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto\\na steep staircase.\\n“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able\\nto find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re\\ngoing to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re always patroll-\\ning the corridors at night.”\\n“No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”\\nHe and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and\\nturned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to\\nbe solid wall.\\n“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and\\nthrowing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.\\nIt melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back\\nand saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark\\ncorridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch\\naround his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his\\nnose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.\\n“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away\\nfrom them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”\\nThey crept off.\\nHarry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had\\nhis heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe\\npassage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor,\\npast suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft foot-\\nsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna\\nwalked, checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice\\npausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n506\\nHe expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was\\nPeeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale\\nsigns of the poltergeist’s approach.\\n“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him\\ntoward a spiral staircase.\\nThey climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here\\nbefore. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole:\\nnothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape\\nof an eagle.\\nLuna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, un-\\nconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded\\nto Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but\\ninstead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the\\nphoenix or the flame?”\\n“Hmm... What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.\\n“What? Isn’t there just a password?”\\n“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna. “What if you get it\\nwrong?”\\n“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said Luna. “That\\nway you learn, you see?”\\n“Yeah... Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.”\\n“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I think the\\nanswer is that a circle has no beginning.”\\n“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open.\\nThe deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier\\nthan any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punc-\\ntuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: By day, the\\nRavenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains.\\nThe ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the\\nmidnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a\\nniche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n507\\nHarry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna’s\\nhouse. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories\\nabove. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look\\nback at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly\\nintimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on\\ntop of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding.\\nThere were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the\\nCloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.\\n“‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’”\\n“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice.\\nHarry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The\\nsloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and\\neven as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull\\nand snake branded on her forearm.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n508\\nCHAPTER THIRTY\\nTHE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE\\nT\\nhe moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s scar burned savagely,\\nthe starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop\\nof rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him and there was\\ntriumph in his heart – They have the boy.\\nA loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he raised\\nhis wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the\\nground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.\\n“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said Luna,\\nsounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought it would be.”\\nAnd sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing\\nfootsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormi-\\ntories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.\\n“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!”\\nLuna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let\\nthe Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Raven-\\nclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. There were\\ngasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious.\\nSlowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n509\\nmoment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her\\nand prodded her backside with his big toe.\\n“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight.\\n“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in\\naround Alecto. “They’re pleased!”\\n“Yeah... great...”\\nHarry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into\\nVoldemort’s mind... He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave...\\nHe had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming... but that would\\nnot take him long...\\nThere was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze.\\nFrom the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from\\nthe eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?”\\n“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was\\nthat of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have\\nyou got him? Open the door!”\\nThe Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then,\\nwithout warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody\\nwas firing a gun into the door.\\n“ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter – d’you want to go\\nthe same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus bellowed, shaking\\nthe door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were\\nall backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back\\nup the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether\\nhe ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater\\ncould do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the\\ndoor.\\n“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?”\\n“Trying – to get – through this damned – door!” shouted Amycus. “Go\\nand get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!”\\n“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor McGonagall. “Didn’t\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n510\\nProfessor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request?\\nPerhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t wake up half\\nthe castle.”\\n“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now!”\\n“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with awful cold-\\nness. There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked\\nagain, “Where do Vanished objects go?”\\n“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,” replied Professor McGona-\\ngall.\\n“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung\\nopen.\\nThe few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as\\nAmycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his\\nsister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on\\nAlecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.\\n“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll Cruciate the\\nlot of ‘em till they tell me who did it – and what’s the Dark Lord going to\\nsay?” he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the\\nforehead with his fist. “We haven’t got him, and they’ve gorn and killed\\nher!”\\n“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had\\nstooped down to examine Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.”\\n“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not after the Dark\\nLord gets hold of her! She’s gorn and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and\\nhe thinks we’ve got Potter!”\\n“‘Got Potter’?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do you mean,\\n‘got Potter’?”\\n“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send\\nfor him if we caught him!”\\n“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter\\nbelongs in my House!”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n511\\nBeneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her\\nvoice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.\\n“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I dunno why, do I?”\\nProfessor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room.\\nTwice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.\\n“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly\\ncrafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll say Alecto was ambushed by the\\nkids, them kids up there” – he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the\\ndormitories – “and we’ll say they forced her to press her Mark, and that’s\\nwhy he got a false alarm... He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less,\\nwhat’s the difference?”\\n“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,” said\\nProfessor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which\\nyou and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing\\nvery clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the\\nstudents of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.”\\n“Excuse me?”\\nAmycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor\\nMcGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but\\nlooked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck\\nto a lavatory seat.\\n“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time’s\\nover. It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay\\nthe price.”\\nAnd he spat in her face.\\nHarry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You\\nshouldn’t have done that.”\\nAs Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”\\nThe Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a\\ndrowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and\\na shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n512\\ninsensible, to the floor.\\n“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through\\nhis brain, “you need to really mean it.”\\n“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter\\n– you’re here! What –? How –?” She struggled to pull herself together.\\n“Potter, that was foolish!”\\n“He spat at you,” said Harry.\\n“Potter, I – that was very – very gallant of you – but don’t you realize–?”\\n“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him.\\n“Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.”\\n“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of\\ninterest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second out-\\nlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward\\nand fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing\\ngown.\\n“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry told Luna.\\n“He already knows where I am.”\\nIn a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning\\nscar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly\\ngreen boat... He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood...\\n“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as\\nquickly as you can!”\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you\\nknow where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”\\n“The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not – hasn’t it been lost for cen-\\nturies?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter mad-\\nness, for you to enter this castle –”\\n“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden here that I’m\\nsupposed to find, and it could be the diadem – if I could just speak to\\nProfessor Flitwick –”\\nThere was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n513\\nround. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her\\nfeet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.”\\nAmycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then\\nshuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with\\nhis own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGona-\\ngall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared\\nout of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly to-\\ngether.\\n“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with\\nsuperb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament, “if He-Who-Must-Not-\\nBe-Named does indeed know that you are here –”\\nAs she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry,\\nsetting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose\\npotion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the\\nsurface –\\n“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back: He was\\nclutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself.\\n“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m acting\\non Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve\\ngot to get the students out while I’m searching the castle – it’s me Vol-\\ndemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not now\\n–” not now he knows I’m attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence\\nin his head.\\n“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of\\ndawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.\\n“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while\\nyou search for this – this object.”\\n“Is that possible?”\\n“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are rather\\ngood at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a\\nwhile if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n514\\nbe done about Professor Snape –”\\n“Let me –”\\n“– and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord\\nat the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people\\nout of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and\\nApparition impossible within the grounds –”\\n“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passa-\\ngeway leading into the Hog’s Head.\\n“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students –”\\n“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concent-\\nrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s\\nDisapparating out of the Hog’s Head.”\\n“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand at the\\nCarrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around\\nthem, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath the blue-\\nandgold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. “Come. We must alert the\\nother Heads of House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.”\\nShe marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand.\\nFrom the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their\\neyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with sil-\\nvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down.\\nAlong the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them;\\nProfessor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and\\nHarry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.\\nThey had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps\\njoined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: He felt\\nin the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before he could\\ntake it out, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company. She\\nhalted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?”\\n“It is I,” said a low voice.\\nFrom behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n515\\nHatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten the details\\nof Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his\\ngreasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes\\nhad a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in\\nhis usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.\\n“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.\\n“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Professor McGo-\\nnagall.\\nSnape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall\\ninto the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his\\nwand up too, ready to attack.\\n“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had apprehended\\nan intruder.”\\n“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you that impre-\\nssion?”\\nSnape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark\\nMark was branded into his skin.\\n“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eaters have\\nyour own private means of communication, I forgot.”\\nSnape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air\\nall about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly\\nnoticing what he was doing.\\n“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.”\\n“You have some objection?”\\n“I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour?”\\n“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“Really? But all seems calm.” Snape looked into her eyes.\\n“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must in-\\nsist–”\\nProfessor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her\\nwand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n516\\nmust crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such\\nthat McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a\\ntorch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape,\\nwas forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which\\nbecame a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape –\\nThen it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall\\nblasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a\\nswarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of\\narmor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after\\nanother, into its breast –\\n“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding\\nLuna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting\\nup the corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous\\nProfessor Slughorn panting along at the rear.\\n“No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do no more murder at\\nHogwarts!”\\nFlitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken\\nshelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing\\narms and sent it flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had to\\ndive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When\\nHarry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and\\nSprout all thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom door and,\\nmoments later, he heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”\\n“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna.\\nHarry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing\\nthe Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Pro-\\nfessors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed win-\\ndow.\\n“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the\\nroom.\\n“You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flit-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n517\\nwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.\\n“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he\\nwas still carrying a wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from\\nhis master.”\\nWith a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape\\nflying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.\\nThere were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing:\\nSlughorn had just caught up.\\n“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-\\ngreen silk pajamas. “My dear boy... what a surprise... Minerva, do please\\nexplain... Severus... what...?”\\n“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor McGonagall,\\npointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.\\n“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the\\nInferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat\\nbump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder\\nin his heart –\\n“Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!”\\n“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” she told the other\\nteachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. “Potter\\nhas work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in\\nplace every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he\\nneeds to do.”\\n“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-\\nKnow-Who indefinitely?” squeaked Flitwick.\\n“But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout.\\n“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two\\nwitches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I suggest we establish\\nbasic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the\\nGreat Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over\\nage wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n518\\n“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. “I\\nshall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.”\\nAnd as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, “Tentacula.\\nDevil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pods... yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters\\nfighting those.”\\n“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out\\nof it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started mutter-\\ning incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as\\nthough Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.\\n“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, “Profe-\\nssor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea\\nwhere the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”\\n“– Protego Horribilis – the diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked Flitwick.\\n“A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would\\nbe much use in this situation!”\\n“I only meant – do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?”\\n“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy!”\\nHarry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then,\\nwas the Horcrux?\\n“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said\\nProfessor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.\\nThey had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech.\\n“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver.\\n“What a to-do! I’m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound\\nto find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be\\nin most grievous peril –”\\n“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes,\\nalso,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your students,\\nwe shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance\\nor take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.”\\n“Minerva!” he said, aghast.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n519\\n“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,”\\ninterrupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your students, Horace.”\\nHarry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran after Pro-\\nfessor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corri-\\ndor and raised her wand.\\n“Piertotum – oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now –”\\nThe aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, “Students\\nout of bed! Students in the corridors!”\\n“They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGonagall.\\n“Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!”\\n“P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name\\nbefore.\\n“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining about\\nhim for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!”\\nFilch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her\\nsenses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.\\n“And now – Piertotum Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall.\\nAnd all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down\\nfrom their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and\\nbelow, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the\\nsame.\\n“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “Man the\\nboundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”\\nClattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry:\\nsome of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and\\nthe clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.\\n“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better re-\\nturn to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall – I shall rouse the other\\nGryffindors.”\\nThey parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna running back\\ntoward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n520\\nthey met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their\\npajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.\\n“That was Potter!”\\n“Harry Potter!”\\n“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”\\nBut Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the\\nRoom of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which\\nopened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.\\n“Wh –?”\\nAs the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It\\nwas packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley\\nand Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Ange-\\nlina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.\\n“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the\\nstairs.\\n“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school – Snape’s run\\nfor it – What are you doing here? How did you know?”\\n“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred explained.\\n“You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the\\nOrder of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.”\\n“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?”\\n“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the\\nGreat Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.”\\nThere was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was\\npressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of\\nthe Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old Quidditch\\nteam, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.\\n“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand;\\nshe took it and followed him back up the stairs.\\nThe crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained below in\\nthe Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n521\\nstruggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and\\nFleur.\\n“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry app-\\nroached. “I won’t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go home!”\\n“I won’t!”\\nGinny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip. “I’m in\\nDumbledore’s Army –”\\n“A teenagers’ gang!”\\n“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one else has\\ndared to do!” said Fred.\\n“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old enough! What you\\ntwo were thinking, bringing her with you –”\\nFred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.\\n“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Everyone\\nunderage will have to leave, it’s only right.”\\n“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “My\\nwhole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing\\nand–”\\nHer eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly,\\nbut he shook his head and she turned away bitterly.\\n“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog’s\\nHead. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, and –”\\nThere was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clambered\\nout of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on\\nthe nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and\\nsaid, “Am I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so I – I –”\\nPercy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into\\nmost of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by\\nFleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break\\nthe tension, “So – ‘ow eez leetle Teddy?”\\nLupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n522\\nto be solidifying, like ice.\\n“I – oh yes – he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with him – at\\nher mother’s –”\\nPercy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen.\\n“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside\\nhis jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a\\ntuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera.\\n“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his pho-\\ntograph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a – a –”\\n“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,” said Fred.\\nPercy swallowed.\\n“Yes, I was!”\\n“Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred, holding out his hand to\\nPercy.\\nMrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and\\npulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes\\non his father.\\n“I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said.\\nMr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son.\\n“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George.\\n“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under\\nhis glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had to find a way out\\nand it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning traitors all the time.\\nI managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes\\nago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.”\\n“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,”\\nsaid George in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now\\nlet’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.”\\n“So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur\\nas they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George.\\n“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n523\\nGinny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak\\nupstairs too.\\n“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay here, then\\nat least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but she won’t be\\nin the middle of the fighting?”\\n“I –”\\n“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, you stay in this\\nroom, you hear me?”\\nGinny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s unusually\\nstern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the\\nstairs as well.\\n“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?”\\n“They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley called\\nover his shoulder.\\n“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry.\\n“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not long after you\\nleft.”\\n“A bathroom?”\\nHarry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of\\nRequirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.\\n“You’re sure they said bath –?”\\nBut then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was\\nlooking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boars on pillars\\nat either side, looking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which\\nwas ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was\\npossessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n524\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\\nTHE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS\\nT\\nhe enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with\\nstars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled\\nstudents, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there\\nshone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and\\ndead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the\\nraised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining\\nteachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the\\nOrder of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.\\n“...evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey.\\nPrefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your\\ncharges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.”\\nMany of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the\\nwalls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Mac-\\nmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we want\\nto stay and fight?”\\nThere was a smattering of applause.\\n“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. “Our\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n525\\ntrunks, our owls?”\\n“We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n“The important thing is to get you out of here safely.”\\n“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the Slytherin table.\\n“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor\\nMcGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs,\\nand Ravenclaws.\\nHarry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for\\nRon and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great\\ndeal of whispering broke out in his wake.\\n“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGo-\\nnagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we rein-\\nforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as\\nyour prefects –”\\nBut her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout\\nthe Hall. It was high, cold, and clear: There was no telling from where it\\ncame; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had\\nonce commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries.\\n“I know that you are preparing to fight.” There were screams amongst the\\nstudents, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for\\nthe source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do\\nnot want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do\\nnot want to spill magical blood.”\\nThere was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against\\nthe eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.\\n“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be\\nharmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give\\nme Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.\\n“You have until midnight.”\\nThe silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in\\nthe place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n526\\nthousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table\\nand he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and scream-\\ned, “But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!”\\nBefore Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gry-\\nffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Sly-\\ntherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the\\nRavenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking\\ntoward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands\\nemerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.\\n“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped\\nvoice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House\\ncould follow.”\\nHarry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins\\ntrooping out on the other side of the Hall.\\n“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.\\nSlowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely\\ndeserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their\\nfellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gry-\\nffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s\\ndescent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way.\\n“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!”\\nHarry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor\\ntable.\\n“Where are Ron and Hermione?”\\n“Haven’t you found –?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.\\nBut he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform\\nto address those who had remained behind.\\n“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A\\nbattle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order\\nof the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to\\ntake groups of fighters up to the three highest towers – Ravenclaw, Astro-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n527\\nnomy, and Gryffindor – where they’ll have a good overview, excellent posi-\\ntions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus” – he indicated Lupin\\n– “Arthur” – he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table\\n– “and I will take groups into the grounds. We’ll need somebody to organize\\ndefense of the entrances of the passageways into the school –”\\n“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating himself and George,\\nand Kingsley nodded his approval.\\n“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!”\\n“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students\\nflooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “Aren’t\\nyou supposed to be looking for something?”\\n“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”\\nHe had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the\\nbattle was being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable\\nabsence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought\\nfrom his mind.\\n“Then go, Potter, go!”\\n“Right – yeah –”\\nHe sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into\\nthe entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself\\nto be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off\\nalong a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought pro-\\ncesses. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but\\nhis thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath\\na glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to\\nmarshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an\\nempty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and\\npulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not\\nsee Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the\\ncrowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he\\nthought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n528\\nhis face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate...\\nVoldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower.\\nThere it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed\\nAlecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be\\none explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux\\nwas connected to that House.\\nBut the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the\\nlost diadem... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it\\npossible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had\\neluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look,\\nwhen nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?\\nIn living memory...\\nBeneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the\\nplinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last\\nhope. The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Re-\\nquirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs.\\nPrefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in\\ntheir own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacha-\\nrias Smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and\\nthere younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for\\nfriends or siblings...\\nHarry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance\\nhall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.\\n“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”\\nHe forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the\\nbottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor\\nTower, stood waiting for him.\\n“Harry! My dear boy!”\\nNick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as\\nthough they had been thrust into icy water.\\n“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n529\\nNearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.\\n“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require –?”\\n“It’s got to be her – d’you know where she is?”\\n“Let’s see…”\\nNick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,\\npeering over the heads of the swarming students.\\n“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”\\nHarry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and\\nsaw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eye-\\nbrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.\\nHarry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she\\nhad disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding\\nsmoothly away from him.\\n“Hey – wait – come back!”\\nShe consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry\\nsupposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length\\ncloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognized her\\nas a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had\\nnever spoken.\\n“You’re the Gray Lady?”\\nShe nodded but did not speak. “The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”\\n“That is correct.”\\nHer tone was not encouraging.\\n“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about\\nthe lost diadem.”\\nA cold smile curved her lips.\\n“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.”\\n“WAIT!”\\nHe had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to over-\\nwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him: It was\\na quarter to midnight.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n530\\n“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got\\nto find it, fast.”\\n“You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said disdain-\\nfully. “Generations of students have badgered me –”\\n“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at her. “It’s\\nabout Voldemort – defeating Voldemort – or aren’t you interested in that?”\\nShe could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and\\nher voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I – how dare you sugg-\\nest–?”\\n“Well, help me, then!”\\nHer composure was slipping.\\n“It – it is not a question of –” she stammered. “My mother’s diadem –”\\n“Your mother’s?”\\nShe looked angry with herself.\\n“When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.”\\n“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!”\\n“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to\\npull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances\\nof defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord –”\\n“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry said\\nfiercely. “There’s no time to explain – but if you care about Hogwarts, if\\nyou want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you\\nknow about the diadem!”\\nShe remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a\\nsense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known any-\\nthing, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked\\nher the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away when\\nshe spoke in a low voice.\\n“I stole the diadem from my mother.”\\n“You – you did what?”\\n“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. “I sought\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n531\\nto make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with\\nit.”\\nHe did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence, and did\\nnot ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on:\\n“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but\\npretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal,\\neven from the other founders of Hogwarts.\\n“Then my mother fell ill – fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was\\ndesperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me,\\nthough I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest\\nuntil he had done so.”\\nHarry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.\\n“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return\\nwith him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man.\\nFurious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.”\\n“The Baron? You mean –?”\\n“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the\\ncloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. “When he\\nsaw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon\\nthat had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later,\\nhe wears his chains as an act of penitence... as he should,” she added bitterly.\\n“And... and the diadem?”\\n“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering\\nthrough the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.”\\n“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?”\\n“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mo-\\nther’s reach.”\\n“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from\\nconfusion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had\\ndenied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told someone this story,\\nhaven’t you? Another student?” She closed her eyes and nodded.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n532\\n“I had... no idea... He was... flattering. He seemed to... to understand... to\\nsympathize…”\\nYes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena\\nRavenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.\\n“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,” Harry\\nmuttered. “He could be charming when he wanted…”\\nSo Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem\\nout of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved\\nthe diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts,\\nbefore he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.\\nAnd wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent\\nrefuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, un-\\ndisturbed, for ten long years?\\nBut the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left\\nin that lowly tree... No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true\\nhome, and Voldemort must have put it there –\\n“– the night he asked for a job!” said Harry, finishing his thought. “I beg\\nyour pardon?”\\n“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let\\nhim teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it\\nall. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dum-\\nbledore’s office! But it was still worth trying to get the job – then he\\nmight’ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor’s sword as well – thank you,\\nthanks!”\\nHarry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded\\nthe corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five\\nminutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was,\\nhe was no closer to discovering where it was...\\nGenerations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that\\nit was not in Ravenclaw Tower – but if not there, where? What hiding place\\nhad Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n533\\nremain secret forever?\\nLost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken\\nonly a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke\\nopen with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body\\nflew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. Something large and\\nfurry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at\\nHarry.\\n“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions\\nas the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet. “What the –?”\\n“Harry, yer here! Yer here!”\\nHagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking\\nhug, then ran back to the shattered window.\\n“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the window. “I’ll\\nsee yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!”\\nBeyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the\\ndistance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch:\\nIt was midnight. The battle had begun.\\n“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter fight?”\\n“Hagrid, where have you come from?”\\n“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said Hagrid grimly.\\n“Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter.’ Knew\\nyeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we\\ncome ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed our way through the\\nboundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter\\nlet me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him.\\nNot exac’ly what I meant, bu’ – where’s Ron an’ Hermione?”\\n“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.”\\nThey hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them.\\nHarry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running\\nfootsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light\\nin the dark grounds.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n534\\n“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s heels,\\nmaking the floorboards quake.\\n“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn, “but Ron and\\nHermione must be around here somewhere…”\\nThe first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage\\nahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the\\nstaffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another\\nbroken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt\\nover one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly, “Oh, don’t mind\\nme... I’ll just lie here and crumble…”\\nIts ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of\\nRowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s house, wearing that mad headdress –\\nand then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her\\nwhite curls...\\nAnd as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone\\neffigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry\\nhimself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot through\\nHarry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.\\nHe knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him...\\nTom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been\\narrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest\\nmysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those\\nmodel pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had\\nstrayed off the beaten track in his time at school – here at last was a secret\\nhe and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered –\\nHe was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed\\nby Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carry-\\ning what appeared to be large potted plants.\\n“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran.\\n“Going to lob them over the walls – they won’t like this!”\\nHarry knew now where to go: He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang gallop-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n535\\ning behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures\\nraced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor\\nand cloaks, cramming themselves into each others’ canvases, screaming\\nnews from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor,\\nthe whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its\\nplinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more\\nsinister than those of the teachers and the Order.\\n“It’s all righ’, Fang – it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great boar-\\nhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air,\\nand Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone.\\nHe forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and\\nfor the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed\\nfrom painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, scream-\\ning encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him.\\n“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter,\\nsee them off!”\\nHarry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of stu-\\ndents, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another\\nempty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands\\nwere drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.\\n“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry\\nsprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corri-\\ndor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was\\nhissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to\\ntheir proper place...\\n“Potter!”\\nAberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held\\nready.\\n“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!”\\n“I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s –”\\n“– attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aber-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n536\\nforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never\\noccurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of\\nDeath Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter\\nto keep ‘em here?”\\n“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your brother would never\\nhave done it.”\\nAberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.\\nYour brother would never have done it... Well, it was the truth, Harry\\nthought as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so\\nlong, would never have held students ransom...\\nAnd then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled\\nrelief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full\\nof large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm.\\n“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted. “Chamber of Secrets,”\\nsaid Ron.\\n“Chamber – what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.\\n“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Wasn’t it\\nabsolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even\\nif we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t\\ngot rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!”\\n“What the –?”\\n“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply.\\nHarry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione’s\\narms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead\\nbasilisk.\\n“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron.\\n“You need to speak Parseltongue!”\\n“He did!” whispered Hermione. “Show him, Ron!” Ron made a horrible\\nstrangled hissing noise.\\n“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologetically. “I\\nhad to have a few goes to get it right, but,” he shrugged modestly, “we got\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n537\\nthere in the end.”\\n“He was amazing!” said Hermione. “Amazing!”\\n“So...” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So...”\\n“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket\\nhe pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it.\\nThought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.”\\n“Genius!” yelled Harry.\\n“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. “So\\nwhat’s new with you?”\\nAs he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them\\nlooked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.\\n“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said Harry,\\ntalking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where\\neveryone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one\\nto find it. Come on.”\\nAs the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the con-\\ncealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It\\nwas empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch\\nwearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Nevi-\\nlle’s grandmother.\\n“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. “You\\ncan tell us what’s going on.”\\n“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together.\\n“’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the passage to\\nthe Hog’s Head?”\\nHe knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were\\nstill users inside it.\\n“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I sealed it, I\\nthink it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you\\nseen my grandson?”\\n“He’s fighting,” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n538\\n“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I must go and assist\\nhim.”\\nWith surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. Harry looked\\nat Tonks.\\n“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother’s?”\\n“I couldn’t stand not knowing –” Tonks looked anguished. “She’ll look\\nafter him – have you seen Remus?”\\n“He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds –” Without\\nanother word, Tonks sped off.\\n“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a\\nbit. Then you can come back in.”\\nGinny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.\\n“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the\\nsteps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!”\\n“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten someone!”\\n“Who?” asked Hermione.\\n“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?”\\n“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.\\n“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out. We\\ndon’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for us –”\\nThere was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms.\\nRunning at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the\\nmouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and res-\\nponded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.\\n“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened\\nexcept that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and\\nswayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s a war going on here!”\\nRon and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.\\n“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit\\non the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?”\\n“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted. “D’you think\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n539\\nyou could just – just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?”\\n“Yeah – right – sorry –” said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gather-\\ning up fangs, both pink in the face.\\nIt was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs,\\nthat in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the\\nsituation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling\\nwere shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest\\nwindow, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the\\ncastle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place.\\nLooking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what\\nlooked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.\\n“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams echoed\\nfrom close by.\\n“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and saw\\nGinny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which\\nwas missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed\\njinx into a crowd of fighters below.\\n“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and\\nHarry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of\\nstudents past. “They look like they might be breaching the north battle-\\nments, they’ve brought giants of their own!”\\n“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him.\\n“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him since!”\\n“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay –”\\nBut Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. Ginny turned, help-\\nless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they were empty\\nwords. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep\\nsafe – come on!” he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the\\nstretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do\\nthe bidding of the next entrant.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n540\\nI need the place where everything is hidden, Harry begged of it inside his\\nhead, and the door materialized on their third run past.\\nThe furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and\\nclosed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size\\nof a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built of\\nobjects hidden by thousands of long-gone students.\\n“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing\\nin the silence.\\n“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had\\nto hide stuff in my time... this way,” he added, “I think it’s down here…”\\nHe passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy had\\nmended last year with such disastrous consequences, then hesitated, looking\\nup and down aisles of junk; he could not remember where to go next...\\n“Accio Diadem!” cried Hermione in desperation, but nothing flew\\nthrough the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Gringotts, the\\nroom would not yield its hidden objects that easily.\\n“Let’s split up,” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone bust of an\\nold man wearing a wig and a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s defi-\\nnitely somewhere near here…”\\nThey sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps\\nechoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs,\\nbooks, weapons, broomsticks, bats...\\n“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself. “Somewhere... so-\\nmewhere…”\\nDeeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he\\nrecognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in\\nhis ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver: There it was, right ahead,\\nthe blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book, and\\non top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and\\nwhat looked like an ancient, discolored tiara.\\nHe had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten feet away,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n541\\nwhen a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.”\\nHe skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing\\nbehind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through\\nthe small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.\\n“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing his own\\nthrough the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.\\n“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand.\\n“Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”\\n“My mother,” said Draco.\\nHarry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situ-\\nation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have\\nrun out of earshot, searching for the diadem.\\n“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry.\\n“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice was surprisingly soft\\nfor such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before.\\nCrabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. “We\\n‘ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ‘im.”\\n“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that\\nhe was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and\\nGoyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the\\nHorcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before\\nthe fight broke out...\\n“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them.\\n“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” said Mal-\\nfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.”\\n“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can do\\nDisslusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a gormless grin, “you\\nturned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum!\\nWhat’s a die-dum?”\\n“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to\\nHarry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n542\\nWith a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot\\nmountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and\\nunidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”\\nThe wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next\\ndoor where Ron stood.\\n“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed,\\nand Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side\\nof the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, “Finite!”\\nand it steadied.\\n“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made to repeat\\nhis spell. “If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!”\\n“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free. “It’s Potter the\\nDark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?”\\n“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience\\nat the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must mean –”\\n“‘Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity.\\n“Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You\\nan’ your dad are finished.”\\n“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall.\\n“What’s going on?”\\n“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going – no, Potter! Crucio!”\\nHarry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the\\nstone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then\\ndropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.\\n“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the\\nenormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive –”\\n“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy’s\\nrestraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway,\\nwhat’s the diff –?”\\nA jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around\\nthe corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n543\\nIt only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.\\n“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”\\nHarry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to\\nkill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who\\nlurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand out of his hand; it rolled\\nout of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes.\\n“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and\\nGoyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s hesitation was\\nall Harry needed.\\n“Expelliarmus!”\\nGoyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of\\nobjects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it;\\nMalfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second Stunning Spell, and Ron,\\nappearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at\\nCrabbe, which narrowly missed.\\nCrabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada Kedavra!” again. Ron\\nleapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wandless Malfoy cower-\\ned behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitt-\\ning Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came.\\n“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk\\ninto which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go and help R –”\\n“HARRY!” she screamed.\\nA roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s warning. He\\nturned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the\\naisle toward them.\\n“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran.\\nBut he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of\\nabnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk\\nbulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.\\n“Aguamenti!” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip\\nof his wand evaporated in the air.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n544\\n“RUN!”\\nMalfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe\\noutstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\npelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire;\\nCrabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge: As they turned\\na corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent\\nupon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of\\nfiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and\\nrose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was\\nthrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet,\\nbefore being consumed by the inferno.\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing\\ncloser and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid\\nas a wall around them.\\n“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the\\nfire. “What can we do?”\\n“Here!”\\nHarry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile\\nof junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him.\\nHarry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the\\nground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a\\nflaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were\\nbecoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the\\ncontraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a\\nthousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had\\nsought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe,\\nor Goyle anywhere: He swooped as low as he dared over the marauding\\nmonsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What\\na terrible way to die He had never wanted this...\\n“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it was imposs-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n545\\nible to see where the door was through the black smoke.\\nAnd then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the\\nterrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.\\n“It’s – too – dangerous –!” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His\\nglasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the\\nfirestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet\\ncharred like wood...\\nAnd he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle,\\nthe pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry\\ndived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry\\ngrasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and\\nMalfoy’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry’s –\\n“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared Ron’s\\nvoice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and\\nHermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching,\\ninto the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.\\n“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in Harry’s ear,\\nand Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the\\nbillowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last\\nfew objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the\\ncreatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields,\\na sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara –\\n“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!” screamed\\nMalfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to\\nfall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of\\na yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist –\\nHarry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and\\nstraight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open: Ron,\\nHermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding\\nHarry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular\\npatch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n546\\nfilled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.\\nMalfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and\\nretching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Require-\\nment had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside\\nGoyle, who was still unconscious.\\n“C-Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. “C-Crabbe...”\\n“He’s dead,” said Ron harshly.\\nThere was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of\\nhuge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures\\ngalloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their\\narms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and\\nlooked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear\\nmore screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.\\n“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was supposed to\\nbe going back into the Room of Requirement.”\\n“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked Ron, but he\\ntoo got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. “Shall we\\nsplit up and look –?”\\n“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained\\nslumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. “Let’s\\nstick together. I say we go – Harry, what’s that on your arm?”\\n“What? Oh yeah –”\\nHe pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot,\\nblackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make\\nout the tiny words etched upon it: WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN’S\\nGREATEST TREASURE.\\nA bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the\\ndiadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in\\nhis hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant\\nscream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the\\nthing that had just fragmented in his fingers.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n547\\n“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the\\nbroken pieces.\\n“Sorry?”\\n“Fiendfyre – cursed fire – it’s one of the substances that destroy Hor-\\ncruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so dangerous – how\\ndid Crabbe know how to –?”\\n“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly.\\n“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it,\\nreally,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed, and whose face\\nwas blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite sorry he was\\ndead.”\\n“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if we can\\njust get the snake –”\\nBut she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of duel-\\ning filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail:\\nDeath Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into\\nview, both of them dueling masked and hooded men.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every\\ndirection and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped\\nand they saw a high forehead and streaked hair –\\n“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thick-\\nnesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently\\nin awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m resigning?”\\n“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling\\ncollapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse\\nhad fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed\\nto be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.\\n“You actually are joking, Perce I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since\\nyou were –”\\nThe air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Her-\\nmione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n548\\nother Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed\\ntemporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying\\nthrough the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that\\nthin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in\\nhis arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope\\nof knowing what had happened to them –\\nAnd then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was\\nhalf buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible\\nattack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away,\\nand hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously.\\nThen he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony\\nof a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying,\\nmore frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than\\nhe had been in his life...\\nAnd Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three red-\\nheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart.\\nHarry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone\\nand wood.\\n“No – no – no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!”\\nAnd Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them,\\nand Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched\\nupon his face.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n549\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\\nTHE ELDER WAND\\nT\\nhe world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen\\nsilent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry’s mind\\nwas in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility,\\nbecause Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must\\nbe lying –\\nAnd then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school, and\\ncurses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads.\\n“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He\\nand Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy\\nlay across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry\\nshouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” he shook his head.\\n“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s face as\\nhe seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not\\nbudge. “Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re going to –”\\nHermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A\\nmonstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the\\nhuge hole in the wall: One of Aragog’s descendants had joined the fight.\\nRon and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n550\\nblown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness.\\n“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of\\nthe castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant\\nspiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden\\nForest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired\\nStunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fell-\\nows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more\\ncurses came soaring over Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them\\nblow his hair.\\n“Let’s move, NOW!”\\nPushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred’s\\nbody under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopp-\\ned clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the\\ncurses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.\\n“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor\\nhad stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he\\nhad to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off\\nafter Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of\\nthe corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long\\ngone from the windows, he saw many people running backward and for-\\nward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy\\nlet out a bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction of\\na tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.\\n“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed.\\nShe had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling\\ntogether, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing\\nagain; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him\\nrunning after Percy.\\n“Listen to me – LISTEN, RON!”\\n“I wanna help – I wanna kill Death Eaters –”\\nHis face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shak-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n551\\ning with rage and grief.\\n“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please – Ron – we need the\\nsnake, we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione.\\nBut Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring\\nthe satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the\\npeople who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and\\nabove all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not – but he could not\\npermit that idea to form in his mind –\\n“We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the snake! But\\nlet’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be d-doing! We’re the\\nonly ones who can end it!”\\nShe was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve\\nas she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still\\nkeeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry.\\n“You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he’ll have the snake\\nwith him, won’t he? Do it, Harry – look inside him!”\\nWhy was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearn-\\ning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her comm-\\nand, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds\\nof the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood\\nfar, far away from them...\\nHe was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room,\\nwith peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one.\\nThe sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single\\nunblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood,\\nbut inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.\\nHe was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his thoughts on\\nthe room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room,\\nlike the Chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to\\ndiscover... He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem...\\nalthough Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he had ever\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n552\\nexpected... too far...\\n“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: There was\\nLucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the\\nmarks of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last escape. One of\\nhis eyes remained closed and puffy. “My Lord... please... my son…”\\n“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join\\nme, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry\\nPotter?”\\n“No – never,” whispered Malfoy. “You must hope not.”\\n“Aren’t – aren’t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at another\\nhand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t it be... forgive\\nme... more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-\\nyourself?”\\n“Do not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can\\ndiscover what has happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter.\\nBefore the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.”\\nVoldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It\\ntroubled him... and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be\\nrearranged...\\n“Go and fetch Snape.”\\n“Snape, m-my Lord?”\\n“Snape. Now. I need him. There is a – service – I require from him. Go.”\\nFrightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room.\\nVoldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers,\\nstaring at it.\\n“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and\\nthere was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting grace-\\nfully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry,\\ntransparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.\\nWith a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment\\nhis ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n553\\nof battle.\\n“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of\\nmagical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.”\\n“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged.\\n“He’s not – he’s not even fighting?”\\n“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to\\ngo to him.”\\n“But why?”\\n“He knows I’m after Horcruxes – he’s keeping Nagini close beside him\\n– obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing –”\\n“Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s what\\nhe wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and\\nI’ll go and get it –”\\nHarry cut across Ron.\\n“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as\\nI–”\\n“No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak\\nand–”\\n“Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her.\\nBefore Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as capable –” the\\ntapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.\\n“POTTER!”\\nTwo masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were\\nfully raised, Hermione shouted, “Glisseo!”\\nThe stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry, and\\nRon hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death\\nEaters’ Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the\\nconcealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the oppo-\\nsite wall.\\n“Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there\\nwere two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n554\\nDeath Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.\\n“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione flattened them-\\nselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherd-\\ned by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them:\\nHer hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned\\nthe corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!”\\n“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind us –”\\nBut he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he doubted\\nanyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the\\nair, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells.\\nThey ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full\\nof duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with\\nfigures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both\\nmasked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself\\na wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the\\nduelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong\\nlikelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they\\nstood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great\\n“Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them,\\ndropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were\\nsuddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms.\\n“Argh!”\\nA fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the slimy green\\nroots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them\\nloose.\\n“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing.\\nDean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distraction, knock-\\ning him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate and\\nParvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him.\\n“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n555\\nCloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst\\nof the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top\\nof the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\\n“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!”\\nDraco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death\\nEater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around,\\nbeaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Mal-\\nfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly\\nbemused. “And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you\\ntwo-faced bastard!” Ron yelled.\\nThere were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters\\neverywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with\\nFlitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them. Stu-\\ndents ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends.\\nHarry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed\\nbut nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls\\nof Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest\\nDeath Eater and began reeling him in.\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass shatter-\\ned to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points\\nspilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they\\nran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground,\\nand a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the\\nhall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen.\\n“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand,\\nFenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of\\nLavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his\\nfeet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of\\nhis head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.\\n“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters.\\n“More for any who want them! Here –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n556\\nAnd with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous\\ncrystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the\\nball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same\\nmoment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic\\nspiders forced their way into the entrance hall.\\nScreams of terror rent the air: The fighters scattered, Death Eaters and\\nHogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the\\noncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever.\\n“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either\\nHarry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come\\nthundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.\\n“Don’t hurt ‘em, don’t hurt ‘em!” he yelled. “HAGRID, NO!”\\nHarry forgot everything else: He sprinted out from under the Cloak,\\nrunning bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.\\n“HAGRID, COME BACK!”\\nBut he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid\\nvanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming\\nmovement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in\\ntheir midst.\\n“HAGRID!”\\nHarry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did\\nnot care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and\\nthe spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing\\nof Hagrid at all.\\n“HAGRID!”\\nHe thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst\\nof the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was\\nimpeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and\\nmade the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood\\nbefore him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its\\ntreelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n557\\nbrutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window,\\nand glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of\\nthe doorway. “Oh my –!” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up\\nwith Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through\\nthe window above.\\n“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her\\nwand. “Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle –”\\n“HAGGER?”\\nGrawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry\\nrealize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan mon-\\nster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a\\nroar. The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and\\nGrawp’s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth;\\nand then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.\\n“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as\\nthe giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps\\ninto the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of\\nfinding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the\\nforest before they were brought up short again.\\nThe air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and solidified in\\nhis chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concen-\\ntrated blackness, moving in a great wave toward the castle, their faces\\nhooded and their breath rattling...\\nRon and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind\\nthem grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors\\ncould bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and\\nHagrid was surely dying or already dead...\\n“Come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way away.\\n“Patronuses, Harry, come on!”\\nHe raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him:\\nHow many more lay dead that he did not yet know about; he felt as though\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n558\\nhis soul had already half left his body...\\n“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione.\\nA hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their\\nway closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a promise of a feast...\\nHe saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire;\\nhe saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade; and his own wand\\ntrembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the\\npromise of nothing, of no feeling...\\nAnd then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Her-\\nmione’s heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach.\\nThree more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them,\\ntheir wands outstretched, continuing to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie,\\nand Seamus.\\n“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room\\nof Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A. “That’s right,\\nHarry... come on, think of something happy “\\n“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked.\\n“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come on,\\nnow…”\\nThere was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest\\neffort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end of Harry’s wand. It\\ncantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and imme-\\ndiately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle\\nwere loud in his ears.\\n“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and\\nSeamus, “you just saved –”\\nWith a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out\\nof the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller\\nthan any of them.\\n“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling: They all\\nscattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the creature’s vast\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n559\\nfoot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round:\\nRon and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished\\nback into the battle.\\n“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and\\nits bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red\\nand green light continued to illuminate the darkness.\\n“The Whomping Willow,” said Harry, “go!”\\nSomehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space\\ninto which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his\\nterror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must\\nall wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort,\\nbecause that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it –\\nHe sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the\\njets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake\\ncrashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the\\nnight was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen\\nin rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he\\nwho saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots\\nwith whiplike, slashing branches.\\nPanting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow’s swiping\\nbranches, peering through the darkness toward its thick trunk, trying to see\\nthe single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and\\nHermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath she could not speak.\\n“How – how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can – see the place –\\nif we just had – Crookshanks again –”\\n“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest.\\n“Are you a wizard, or what?”\\n“Oh – right – yeah –”\\nRon looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and\\nsaid, “Wingardium Leviosa!” The twig flew up from the ground, spun\\nthrough the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n560\\ntrunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a\\nplace near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still.\\n“Perfect!” panted Hermione. “Wait.”\\nFor one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled\\nthe air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to\\ncome... Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?\\nBut then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only\\nway forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was,\\nand Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel...\\n“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.\\nHarry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was\\na much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it.\\nThe tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through\\nit nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl.\\nHarry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet\\nbarriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon\\nthe swinging beam of the wand held in his fist.\\nAt last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light\\nahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.\\n“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”\\nHe groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into\\nhis free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, “Nox,”\\nextinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as\\nsilently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be\\ndiscovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light.\\nAnd then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them,\\nonly slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel\\nhad been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to\\nbreathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap\\nleft between crate and wall.\\nThe room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n561\\ncoiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which\\nfloated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a\\nlongfingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and\\nHarry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched,\\nhidden.\\n“... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling –”\\n“– and it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in his high, clear\\nvoice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make\\nmuch difference now. We are almost there... almost.”\\n“Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my\\nLord. Please.”\\nSnape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes\\nfixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might\\npenetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything.\\nOne failed attempt, and he would give away his position...\\nVoldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flatt-\\nened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semi-\\ndarkness.\\n“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly. “My Lord?” said\\nSnape.\\nVoldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely\\nas a conductor’s baton.\\n“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?”\\nIn the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as\\nit coiled and uncoiled – or was it Voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the\\nair?\\n“My – my Lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not understand. You – you\\nhave performed extraordinary magic with that wand.”\\n“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I am extra-\\nordinary, but this wand... no. It has not revealed the wonders it has pro-\\nmised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n562\\nOllivander all those years ago.”\\nVoldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun to throb\\nand pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that\\ncontrolled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.\\n“No difference,” said Voldemort again.\\nSnape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He wondered whether\\nSnape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his\\nmaster.\\nVoldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for\\nseconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the\\npain and fury mounted in Harry.\\n“I have thought long and hard, Severus... Do you know why I have called\\nyou back from the battle?”\\nAnd for a moment Harry saw Snape’s profile: His eyes were fixed upon\\nthe coiling snake in its enchanted cage.\\n“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.”\\n“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He\\ndoes not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know his weakness, you\\nsee, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around\\nhim, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any\\ncost. He will come.”\\n“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than your-\\nself–”\\n“My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture\\nPotter. Kill his friends – the more, the better – but do not kill him.\\n“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You\\nhave been very valuable to me. Very valuable.”\\n“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But – let me go and find the\\nboy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can –”\\n“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red\\nin his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n563\\nslithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar.\\n“My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally\\nmeet the boy!”\\n“My Lord, there can be no question, surely –?”\\n“– but there is a question, Severus. There is.”\\nVoldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the\\nElder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape.\\n“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?”\\n“I – I cannot answer that, my Lord.”\\n“Can’t you?”\\nThe stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head: He forced\\nhis own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed\\nhis eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale face.\\n“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to\\nkill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the\\ntwin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I did so, but Lucius’s wand\\nshattered upon meeting Potter’s.”\\n“I – I have no explanation, my Lord.”\\nSnape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed\\nupon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.\\n“I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny,\\nthe Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of\\nAlbus Dumbledore.”\\nAnd now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a death\\nmask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to\\nsee that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.\\n“My Lord – let me go to the boy –”\\n“All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,”\\nsaid Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, won-\\ndering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to\\nperform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner... and I think I\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n564\\nhave the answer.” Snape did not speak.\\n“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus.\\nYou have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must\\nhappen.”\\n“My Lord –”\\n“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not\\nits true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last\\nowner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder\\nWand cannot be truly mine.”\\n“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand.\\n“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the wand,\\nSeverus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”\\nAnd Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to\\nSnape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But\\nthen Voldemort’s intention became clear. The snake’s cage was rolling\\nthrough the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had\\nencased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.\\n“Kill.”\\nThere was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the little color\\nit had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs\\npierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his\\nknees gave way and he fell to the floor.\\n“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.\\nHe turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to\\nleave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full\\nbidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted\\nupward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from\\nthe wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward\\nglance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere.\\nBack in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had\\ndrawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n565\\nhe was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a\\nfoot in a black boot trembling on the floor.\\n“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his\\nwand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted\\nsideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the\\nroom.\\nHe did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying\\nman: He did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s white face, and the\\nfingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the\\nInvisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening\\nblack eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape\\nseized the front of his robes and pulled him close.\\nA terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat. “Take... it...\\nTake... it…”\\nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue,\\nneither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes,\\nand Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do –\\nA flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by\\nHermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When\\nthe flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no\\nblood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes slackened.\\n“Look... at... me“ he whispered.\\nThe green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the\\ndepths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and\\nempty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no\\nmore.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n566\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\\nTHE PRINCE’S TALE\\nH\\narry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply staring down at him,\\nuntil quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry\\njumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Vol-\\ndemort had reentered the room.\\nVoldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry rea-\\nlized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that\\nthe residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would\\nhear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their\\nnecks, a deathblow away.\\n“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord Voldemort\\nknows how to value bravery.\\n“Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you\\nwill all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical\\nblood spilled is a loss and a waste.\\n“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat imme-\\ndiately. “You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your\\ninjured.\\n“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n567\\nfriends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour\\nin the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to\\nme, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall\\nenter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish\\nevery last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me.\\nOne hour.”\\nBoth Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.\\n“Don’t listen to him,” said Ron.\\n“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s – let’s get back to the\\ncastle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new plan –”\\nShe glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance.\\nRon followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked\\ndown at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape\\nhad been killed, and the reason for which it had been done...\\nThey crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry\\nwondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in\\ntheir heads, as he could.\\nYou have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me\\nyourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest... One hour...\\nSmall bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could\\nonly be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them\\nhurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small boat, lay\\nabandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his\\nattacker.\\nThe castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no\\nbangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall\\nwere stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor,\\nalong with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had\\nbeen blown away.\\n“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione.\\nRon led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n568\\nThe House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors\\nstood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks. The injured were\\nbeing treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of\\nhelpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he\\nshook where he lay, unable to stand.\\nThe dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred’s\\nbody, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head;\\nMrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body shaking, Mr. Weasley\\nstroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.\\nWithout a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw\\nHermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug\\nher. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron’s\\nshoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family,\\nHarry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks,\\npale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark,\\nenchanted ceiling.\\nThe Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry\\nreeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not\\nbear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He\\ncould not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if\\nhe had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died...\\nHe turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks He yearned\\nnot to feel... He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything\\nthat was screaming inside him...\\nThe castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined\\nthe mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching\\nthe crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he\\nreached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.\\n“Password?”\\n“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he\\nyearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n569\\nspiral staircase behind.\\nBut when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The\\nportraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster\\nor headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, char-\\nging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a\\nclear view of what was going on.\\nHarry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung\\ndirectly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone\\nPensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto\\nthe desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic\\nmarkings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a\\nblessed relief... Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than\\nhis own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and\\nwithout hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this\\nwould assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.\\nHe fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he\\nstraightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A sin-\\ngle huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging\\nbackward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a\\nclump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mis-\\nmatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat\\nthat might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.\\nHarry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten\\nyears old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin\\nface as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher\\nthan her sister.\\n“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two.\\nBut the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown\\ninto the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great\\nshout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she\\nsoared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n570\\nfar too lightly.\\n“Mummy told you not to!”\\nPetunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the\\nground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips.\\n“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!”\\n“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch what\\nI can do.”\\nPetunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from them-\\nselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a\\nfallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced,\\nevidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia\\nwas near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower\\nsat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped\\noyster.\\n“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.\\n“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom\\nand threw it back to the ground.\\n“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight\\nto the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and\\nthere was definite longing in her voice.\\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself, but had\\njumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward\\ntoward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she\\nwas. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted\\nthe sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.\\n“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.\\nSnape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petu-\\nnia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I know\\nwhat you are.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“You’re... you’re a witch,” whispered Snape. She looked affronted.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n571\\n“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!”\\nShe turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister.\\n“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why\\nhe did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did\\nnot want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking\\nludicrously batlike, like his older self.\\nThe sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one\\nof the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag.\\n“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been watching you\\nfor a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a\\nwizard.”\\nPetunia’s laugh was like cold water.\\n“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered\\nfrom the shock of his unexpected appearance. “I know who you are. You’re\\nthat Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the river,” she told Lily,\\nand it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor\\nrecommendation. “Why have you been spying on us?”\\n“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-\\nhaired in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added\\nspitefully, “you’re a Muggle.”\\nThough Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly\\nmistake the tone.\\n“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at\\nonce, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched\\nthrough the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him,\\nrecognized Snape’s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had\\nbeen planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong...\\nThe scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him.\\nHe was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering\\nthrough their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool\\ngreen shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n572\\nground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less\\npeculiar in the half light.\\n“... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you\\nget letters.”\\n“But I have done magic outside school!”\\n“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when you’re\\na kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,” he nodded importantly,\\n“and they start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.”\\nThere was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it\\nin the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it.\\nThen she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real,\\nisn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there\\nisn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?”\\n“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you\\nand me.”\\n“Really?” whispered Lily.\\n“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd\\nclothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her,\\nbrimful of confidence in his destiny.\\n“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.\\n“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born, so someone from the\\nschool will have to come and explain to your parents.”\\n“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?”\\nSnape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over\\nthe pale face, the dark red hair.\\n“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.”\\n“Good,” said Lily, relaxing: It was clear that she had been worrying.\\n“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the time I was\\nwatching you…”\\nHis voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the\\nleafy ground and was looking up a t the canopy of leaves overhead. He\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n573\\nwatched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.\\n“How are things at your house?” Lily asked. A little crease appeared\\nbetween his eyes. “Fine,” he said.\\n“They’re not arguing anymore?”\\n“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves\\nand began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing.\\n“But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.”\\n“Doesn’t your dad like magic?”\\n“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape. “Severus?”\\nA little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name. “Yeah?”\\n“Tell me about the dementors again.”\\n“What d’you want to know about them for?”\\n“If I use magic outside school –”\\n“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for\\npeople who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban.\\nYou’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re too –”\\nHe turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling\\nnoise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost\\nher footing.\\n“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had\\njumped to his feet.\\n“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”\\nPetunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her\\nstruggling for something hurtful to say.\\n“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s\\nchest. “Your mum’s blouse?”\\nThere was a crack: A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily scream-\\ned: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward\\nand burst into tears.\\n“Tuney!”\\nBut Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. “Did you make\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n574\\nthat happen?”\\n“No.” He looked both defiant and scared.\\n“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did! You hurt her!”\\n“No – no I didn’t!”\\nBut the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran\\nfrom the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and\\nconfused...\\nAnd the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He was on platform nine\\nand three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a\\nthin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape\\nwas staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a\\nlittle apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister;\\nHarry moved closer to listen.\\n“...I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen –” She caught her sister’s hand\\nand held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. “Maybe once\\nI’m there – no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to\\nProfessor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!”\\n“I don’t – want – to – go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back\\nout of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to some stupid castle and\\nlearn to be a – a –”\\nHer pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their\\nowners’ arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages,\\nover the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks\\nonto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries\\nafter a summer apart.\\n“– you think I want to be a – a freak?”\\nLily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand\\naway.\\n“I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.”\\n“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school\\nfor freaks. You and that Snape boy... weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n575\\ngood you’re being separated from normal people. It’s for our safety.”\\nLily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform\\nwith an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she\\nlooked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce.\\n“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the\\nheadmaster and begged him to take you.”\\nPetunia turned scarlet. “Beg? I didn’t beg!”\\n“I saw his reply. It was very kind.”\\n“You shouldn’t have read –” whispered Petunia, “that was my private –\\nhow could you –?”\\nLily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood\\nnearby.\\nPetunia gasped.\\n“That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!”\\n“No – not sneaking –” Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus saw the\\nenvelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts,\\nthat’s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal\\nservice who take care of –”\\n“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said Petunia, now\\nas pale as she had been flushed. “Freak!” she spat at her sister, and she\\nflounced off to where her parents stood...\\nThe scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the\\nHogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already\\nchanged into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to\\ntake off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a com-\\npartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner\\nseat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane.\\nSnape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She\\nglanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been\\ncrying.\\n“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice. “Why not?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n576\\n“Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.”\\n“So what?”\\nShe threw him a look of deep dislike. “So she’s my sister!”\\n“She’s only a –” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe\\nher eyes without being noticed, did not hear him.\\n“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his\\nvoice. “This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!”\\nShe nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.\\n“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had bright-\\nened a little.\\n“Slytherin?”\\nOne of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at\\nall in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry,\\nwhose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window,\\nsaw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air\\nof having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously\\nlacked.\\n“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James\\nasked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry\\nrealized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.\\n“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said. “Blimey,” said\\nJames, “and I thought you seemed all right!” Sirius grinned.\\n“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the\\nchoice?”\\nJames lifted an invisible sword.\\n“‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.” Snape made\\na small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. “Got a problem with that?”\\n“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you’d rather\\nbe brawny than brainy –”\\n“Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius.\\nJames roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n577\\nJames to Sirius in dislike.\\n“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.”\\n“Oooooo...”\\nJames and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he\\npassed.\\n“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door slammed...\\nAnd the scene dissolved once more...\\nHarry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House\\ntables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, “Evans,\\nLily!” He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down\\nupon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto\\nher head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat\\ncried, “Gryffindor!”\\nHarry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it\\nback to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gry-\\nffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad\\nlittle smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room\\nfor her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train,\\nfolded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him.\\nThe roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father\\njoin Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen\\nstudents remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.\\nHarry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his\\nhead. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat.\\nAnd Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from\\nLily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a\\nprefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat\\ndown beside him...\\nAnd the scene changed...\\nLily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently argu-\\ning. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n578\\nhe realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have\\npassed since their Sorting.\\n“... thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying. “Best\\nfriends?”\\n“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round\\nwith! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you\\nsee in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary\\nMacdonald the other day?”\\nLily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin,\\nsallow face.\\n“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all –”\\n“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny –”\\n“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape.\\nHis color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resent-\\nment.\\n“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.\\n“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that Lupin.\\nWhere does he keep going?”\\n“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill –”\\n“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.\\n“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so\\nobsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at night?”\\n“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems\\nto think they are.”\\nThe intensity of his gaze made her blush.\\n“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice. “And\\nyou’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You\\nwent sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James\\nPotter saved you from whatever’s down there –”\\nSnape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved? You\\nthink he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too!\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n579\\nYou’re not going to – I won’t let you –”\\n“Let me? Let me?”\\nLily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once.\\n“I didn’t mean – I just don’t want to see you made a fool of – He fancies\\nyou, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched from him\\nagainst his will. “And he’s not... everyone thinks... big Quidditch hero –”\\nSnape’s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily’s\\neyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.\\n“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting across\\nSnape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea\\nof humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends\\nwith them.”\\nHarry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and\\nAvery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had\\nrelaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s step...\\nAnd the scene dissolved...\\nHarry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L.\\nin Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the\\ncastle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree\\nwhere James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his\\ndistance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted\\nSeverus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said,\\nand it gave him no pleasure to hear it again... He watched as Lily joined the\\ngroup and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her\\nin his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “Mudblood.”\\nThe scene changed...\\n“I’m sorry.”\\n“I’m not interested.”\\n“I’m sorry!”\\n“Save your breath.”\\nIt was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n580\\narms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to\\nGryffindor Tower.\\n“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep\\nhere.”\\n“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just–”\\n“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve made\\nexcuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even\\ntalk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends – you see, you\\ndon’t even deny it! You don’t even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to\\nbe! You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?”\\nHe opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.\\n“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.”\\n“No – listen, I didn’t mean –”\\n“– to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood,\\nSeverus. Why should I be any different?”\\nHe struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she\\nturned and climbed back through the portrait hole...\\nThe corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to re-form: Harry\\nseemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings\\nsolidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness,\\nthe wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult\\nSnape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand,\\nwaiting for something or for someone... His fear infected Harry too, even\\nthough he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his\\nshoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for –\\nThen a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry\\nthought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had\\nflown out of his hand. “Don’t kill me!”\\n“That was not my intention.”\\nAny sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound\\nof the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n581\\naround him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his\\nwand.\\n“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?”\\n“No – no message – I’m here on my own account!”\\nSnape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his straggling\\nblack hair flying around him.\\n“I – I come with a warning – no, a request – please –”\\nDumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew\\nthrough the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and\\nSnape faced each other.\\n“What request could a Death Eater make of me?”\\n“The – the prophecy... the prediction... Trelawney...”\\n“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord Volde-\\nmort?”\\n“Everything – everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is why – it is for\\nthat reason – he thinks it means Lily Evans!”\\n“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It spoke of\\na boy born at the end of July –”\\n“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt\\nher down – kill them all –”\\n“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Volde-\\nmort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchan-\\nge for the son?”\\n“I have – I have asked him –”\\n“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much\\ncontempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. “You do not care,\\nthen, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as\\nyou have what you want?”\\nSnape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.\\n“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her – them – safe. Please.”\\n“And what will you give me in return, Severus?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n582\\n“In – in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to\\nprotest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”\\nThe hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and some-\\nthing was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was\\nslumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking\\ngrim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a\\nman who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.\\n“I thought... you were going... to keep her... safe…”\\n“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dumbledore.\\n“Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would\\nspare her?”\\nSnape’s breathing was shallow.\\n“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore.\\nWith a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.\\n“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the\\nshape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?”\\n“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone... dead…”\\n“Is this remorse, Severus?”\\n“I wish... I wish I were dead…”\\n“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If\\nyou loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is\\nclear.”\\nSnape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words\\nappeared to take a long time to reach him.\\n“What – what do you mean?”\\n“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help\\nme protect Lily’s son.”\\n“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone –”\\n“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger\\nwhen he does.”\\nThere was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n583\\nmastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But\\nnever – never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot\\nbear... especially Potter’s son I want your word!”\\n“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dum-\\nbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. “If\\nyou insist...”\\nThe office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and\\ndown in front of Dumbledore.\\n“– mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted\\nto find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent –”\\n“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, without\\nraising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. “Other teachers\\nreport that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I\\nfind him an engaging child.”\\nDumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep an eye\\non Quirrell, won’t you?”\\nA whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dum-\\nbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from\\nthe Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.\\n“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.\\n“Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears\\nretribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark\\nLord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore’s crooked-nosed profile.\\n“Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.”\\n“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies\\ncame giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted to join him?”\\n“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating figu-\\nres. “I am not such a coward.”\\n“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor\\nKarkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon…”\\nHe walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken...\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n584\\nAnd now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. It was night-\\ntime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the\\ndesk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side,\\nblackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand\\nat the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of\\nthick golden potion down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two,\\nDumbledore’s eyelids fluttered and opened.\\n“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on that ring? It\\ncarries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”\\nMarvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked;\\nthe sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.\\nDumbledore grimaced.\\n“I... was a fool. Sorely tempted...”\\n“Tempted by what?”\\nDumbledore did not answer.\\n“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded furious.\\n“That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can\\nhope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being –”\\nDumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the\\nexpression of one being shown an interesting curio.\\n“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?”\\nDumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a\\nweather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a\\nyear. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is\\nthe sort of curse that strengthens over time.”\\nDumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed\\na matter of little or no concern to him.\\n“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.”\\n“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to\\ndo more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously. He looked down at the\\nbroken ring and the sword. “Did you think that breaking the ring would\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n585\\nbreak the curse?”\\n“Something like that... I was delirious, no doubt...” said Dumbledore.\\nWith an effort he straightened himself in his chair. “Well, really, this makes\\nmatters much more straightforward.”\\nSnape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.\\n“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to\\nhave the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”\\nSnape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk\\nfrom Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the\\nsubject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refu-\\nsal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does\\nnot expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent\\nfailures. Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay\\nthe price.”\\n“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as\\nsurely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the natural\\nsuccessor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”\\nThere was a short pause.\\n“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”\\n“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not\\nneed a spy at Hogwarts?”\\n“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”\\n“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed,\\nas an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect\\nthe students of Hogwarts?”\\nSnape gave a stiff nod.\\n“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is\\nup to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself.\\nOffer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you –”\\n“– much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks\\nI have usurped Lucius’s position.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n586\\n“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental\\nvictims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course,\\nthere is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Vol-\\ndemort’s wrath.”\\nSnape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are\\nyou intending to let him kill you?”\\n“Certainly not. You must kill me.”\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes\\nthe phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.\\n“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with\\nirony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?”\\n“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the moment\\nwill present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,” he\\nindicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen within a\\nyear.”\\n“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do\\nit?”\\n“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not\\nhave it ripped apart on my account.”\\n“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”\\n“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid\\npain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you,\\nSeverus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons\\nwill finish bottom of this year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick,\\npainless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance,\\nGreyback is involved – I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear\\nBellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.”\\nHis tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently\\npierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last\\nSnape gave another curt nod.\\nDumbledore seemed satisfied. “Thank you, Severus...”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n587\\nThe office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling\\ntogether in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.\\n“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted\\ntogether?” Snape asked abruptly.\\nDumbledore looked weary.\\n“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy\\nwill soon have spent more time in detention than out.”\\n“He is his father over again –”\\n“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s.\\nI spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him,\\ninformation I must give him before it is too late.”\\n“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him... you do not trust me.”\\n“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is\\nessential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs\\nto do.”\\n“And why may I not have the same information?”\\n“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a\\nbasket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.”\\n“Which I do on your orders!”\\n“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the\\nconstant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort\\nwhat appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is\\na job I would entrust to nobody but you.”\\n“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency,\\nwhose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark\\nLord’s mind!”\\n“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so long ago\\nhe had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It\\nwas pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry\\nagain, I am sure of it. Not in that way.”\\n“I don’t understand.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n588\\n“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with\\na soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame –”\\n“Souls? We were talking of minds!”\\n“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of\\nthe other.”\\nDumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They\\nwere close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone\\nnear them.\\n“After you have killed me, Severus –”\\n“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of\\nme!” snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. “You take a\\ngreat deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!”\\n“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about serv-\\nices you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young\\nSlytherin friend?”\\nSnape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed.\\n“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not com-\\nplain that I have no confidence in you…”\\nThey were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes\\nsat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking.\\n“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary,\\notherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?”\\n“But what must he do?”\\n“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will\\ncome a time – after my death – do not argue, do not interrupt! There will\\ncome a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his\\nsnake.”\\n“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.\\n“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending\\nthat snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical\\nprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n589\\n“Tell him what?”\\nDumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.\\n“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily\\ncast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded\\nupon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted\\napart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that\\ncollapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that\\nwhich gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with\\nLord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that frag-\\nment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by\\nHarry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.”\\nHarry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel,\\nthey were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears.\\n“So the boy... the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly. “And Volde-\\nmort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”\\nAnother long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought... all these years... that\\nwe were protecting him for her. For Lily.”\\n“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to\\nraise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight\\nshut. “Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a\\nparasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know\\nhim, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his\\ndeath, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.”\\nDumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.\\n“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”\\n“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you\\nwatched die?”\\n“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up.\\n“You have used me.”\\n“Meaning?”\\n“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n590\\nyou. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you\\ntell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter –”\\n“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you\\ngrown to care for the boy, after all?”\\n“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”\\nFrom the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office\\nfloor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dum-\\nbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back\\nto Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.\\n“After all this time?”\\n“Always,” said Snape.\\nAnd the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of\\nDumbledore behind his desk.\\n“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s departure\\nfrom his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise sus-\\npicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must\\nplant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety. Try\\nConfunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take\\npart in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting upon\\nyou to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or\\nHogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows…”\\nNow Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern,\\nMundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concen-\\ntration. “You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured,\\n“that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the only thing\\nthat might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present\\nit as your own idea. You understand?”\\n“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused...\\nNow Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear\\ndark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead\\nwere Lupin and a Harry who was really George... A Death Eater moved\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n591\\nahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back –\\n“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.\\nBut the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed and hit\\nGeorge instead –\\nAnd next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were\\ndripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily.\\nThe second page carried only a few words:\\ncould ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think\\nher mind’s going, personally!\\nLots of love,\\nSnape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it\\ninside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding,\\nso that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion\\nshowing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers...\\nAnd now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas\\nNigellus came hurrying into his portrait.\\n“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mud-\\nblood–”\\n“Do not use that word!”\\n“– the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and\\nI heard her!”\\n“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the head-\\nmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be\\ntaken under conditions of need and valor – and he must not know that you\\ngive it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for\\nhim–”\\n“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n592\\nand pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it\\nfrom which he took the sword of Gryffindor.\\n“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter\\nthe sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes.\\n“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will know what\\nto do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your\\nappearance after George Weasley’s mishap –”\\nSnape turned at the door.\\n“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan…”\\nAnd Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments\\nlater he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just\\nhave closed the door.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n593\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\\nTHE FOREST AGAIN\\nF\\ninally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of\\nthe office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory,\\nHarry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to\\nwalk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dis-\\npose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung\\nhimself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend him-\\nself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in\\nGodric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could sur-\\nvive.\\nHe felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his\\ndread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it\\nwould have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would\\nthere be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time,\\nout into the grounds and into the forest?\\nTerror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum\\npounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought\\nthat it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the\\nthing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n594\\nof death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Vol-\\ndemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself:\\ndying.\\nIf he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left\\nnumber four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix-feather\\nwand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he\\nwould not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched\\nhimself in front of a wand to save someone he loved... He envied even his\\nparents’ deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would\\nrequire a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and\\nmade an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits\\non the walls were all empty.\\nSlowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and\\nmore aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never\\nappreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It\\nwould all be gone... or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came\\nslow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were\\nhis eyes.\\nDumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a\\nbigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that\\nnow. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted\\nhim alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by\\nhow long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the\\njob of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away\\nat the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how\\nelegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the\\nboy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not\\nbe a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.\\nAnd Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he\\nwould keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had\\ntaken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as Volde-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n595\\nmort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he\\nhad discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin,\\nand Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind’s\\neye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient...\\nBut Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake\\nsurvived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after\\nHarry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody.\\nHe wondered who would do it... Ron and Hermione would know what need-\\ned to be done, of course... That would have been why Dumbledore wanted\\nhim to confide in two others... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little\\nearly, they could carry on...\\nLike rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard\\nsurface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die.\\nIt must end.\\nRon and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt\\nas though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes\\nand no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they\\ncould not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him\\nwould waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he\\nhad received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted\\nby Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.\\nHe stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird.\\nPerhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a\\nlifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office\\ndoor.\\nThe castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he\\nhad already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames;\\nthe whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were con-\\ncentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed.\\nHarry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through\\nthe floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n596\\nPerhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped,\\nbut the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front\\ndoors easily.\\nThen Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was\\ncarrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another\\ndull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have\\nsneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in\\ndeath.\\n“You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver Wood,\\nand he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him\\ninto the Great Hall.\\nNeville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his fore-\\nhead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off\\ndown the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies.\\nHarry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were\\nmoving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the\\ndead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione,\\nRon, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have\\ngiven all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then,\\nwould he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this.\\nHe moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in\\nthe morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they\\nwere holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must.\\nHarry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body.\\n“Neville.”\\n“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!”\\nHarry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere,\\nborn out of a desire to make absolutely sure.\\n“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously.\\n“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve got to do.\\nListen – Neville –”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n597\\n“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not thinking of\\nhanding yourself over?”\\n“No,” Harry lied easily. “‘Course not... this is something else. But I might\\nbe out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake, Neville? He’s got\\na huge snake... Calls it Nagini...”\\n“I’ve heard, yeah What about it?”\\n“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case\\nthey–”\\nThe awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it\\nimpossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was\\ncrucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were\\nbackups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people\\nstill knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry’s place:\\nThere would still be three in the secret.\\n“Just in case they’re – busy – and you get the chance –”\\n“Kill the snake?”\\n“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated.\\n“All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you?”\\n“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.”\\nBut Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. “We’re all going\\nto keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”\\n“Yeah, I –”\\nThe suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could\\nnot go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the\\nshoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies.\\nHarry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else\\nwas moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground.\\nHe was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny.\\nHe stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whis-\\npering for her mother.\\n“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to get you\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n598\\ninside.”\\n“But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t want to fight any-\\nmore!”\\n“I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all right.”\\nRipples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout out to\\nthe night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to\\nknow where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to\\nbe sent back home...\\nBut he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known.\\nHe and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home\\nhere...\\nGinny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With\\na huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around\\nas he passed, and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking near-\\nby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back.\\nHagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound\\nof Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those\\nvisits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock\\ncakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs,\\nand Hermione helping him save Norbert...\\nHe moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped.\\nA swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their\\nchill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had\\nno strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own tremb-\\nling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell\\nof the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people\\nhad years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was\\nclinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be\\nable to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch\\nhad been caught, it was time to leave the air...\\nThe Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n599\\nat his neck and he pulled it out.\\nI open at the close.\\nBreathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to\\nmove as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding\\nwas coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close.\\nThis was the moment.\\nHe pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am about to\\ndie.”\\nThe metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s\\nwand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.”\\nThe black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the\\ntwo halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the\\nvertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle repre-\\nsenting the Cloak and the stone were still discernible.\\nAnd again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter\\nabout bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really\\nfetching them: They were fetching him.\\nHe closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times.\\nHe knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around\\nhim that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-\\nstrewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes\\nand looked around.\\nThey were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled\\nmost closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he\\nhad been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies,\\nbut much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there\\nwas the same loving smile.\\nJames was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes\\nin which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses\\nwere a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s.\\nSirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n600\\nhim in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin\\non his face.\\nLupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker\\nand darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so\\nmany adolescent wanderings.\\nLily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew\\nclose to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as\\nthough she would never be able to look at him enough.\\n“You’ve been so brave.”\\nHe could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would\\nlike to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough.\\n“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are... so proud of\\nyou.”\\n“Does it hurt?”\\nThe childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could stop\\nit. “Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than falling asleep.”\\n“And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin.\\n“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came without his\\nvolition. “Any of you. I’m sorry –”\\nHe addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. “– right after\\nyou’d had your son... Remus, I’m sorry –”\\n“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know him... but he will\\nknow why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world\\nin which he could live a happier life.”\\nA chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted\\nthe hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it\\nwould have to be his decision.\\n“You’ll stay with me?”\\n“Until the very end,” said James.\\n“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.\\n“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.” Harry looked\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n601\\nat his mother.\\n“Stay close to me,” he said quietly.\\nAnd he set off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him; he passed\\nthrough it with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and\\ntogether they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their\\nbranches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched\\nthe Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper\\ninto the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he\\nwould find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James,\\nSirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason\\nhe was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other.\\nHis body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working with-\\nout conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he\\nwas about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest\\nwere much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron,\\nHermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as\\nhe stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort...\\nA thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by.\\nHarry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother\\nand father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.\\n“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s got an Invi-\\nsibility Cloak. Could it be –?”\\nTwo figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and\\nHarry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the\\nplace Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently\\nthey could not see anything.\\n“Definitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, d’you reckon?”\\n“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said Dolo-\\nhov, glancing over his shoulder.\\nYaxley looked down at his watch.\\n“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n602\\n“And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.”\\n“Better go back,” said Yaxley. “Find out what the plan is now.”\\nHe and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed\\nthem, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He\\nglanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded\\nencouragement.\\nThey had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and\\nYaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been\\nthe place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his\\nvast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had\\nbeen driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause.\\nA fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell\\nover a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them\\nwere still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on\\nthe outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their\\nfaces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his\\nlong nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw\\nLucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose\\neyes were sunken and full of apprehension.\\nEvery eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed,\\nand his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might\\nhave been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing\\nstill on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game\\nof hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake\\nNagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.\\nWhen Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.\\n“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov.\\nVoldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in\\nthe firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.\\n“My Lord –”\\nBellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n603\\na little bloody but otherwise unharmed.\\nVoldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another\\nword, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.\\n“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his\\neyes on the leaping flames. “I expected him to come.”\\nNobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now\\nthrowing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he\\nwas about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he pulled off the\\nInvisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did\\nnot want to be tempted to fight.\\n“I was, it seems... mistaken,” said Voldemort. “You weren’t.”\\nHarry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He\\ndid not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between\\nhis numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius,\\nand Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment\\nhe felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them.\\nThe illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the\\nDeath Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter.\\nVoldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry,\\nand he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between\\nthem.\\nThen a voice yelled: “HARRY! NO!”\\nHe turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His\\nmassive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.\\n“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH –?”\\n“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was\\nsilenced.\\nBellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort\\nto Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames\\nand the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Volde-\\nmort’s head.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n604\\nHarry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to\\ndraw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he\\nmanaged to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And\\nstill, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted\\nhis head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a\\nsingularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.\\n“Harry Potter,” he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the\\nspitting fire. “The Boy Who Lived.”\\nNone of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was\\nwaiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry\\nthought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips\\non his –\\nVoldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like\\na curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry\\nlooked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while\\nhe could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear –\\nHe saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was\\ngone.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n605\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\\nKING’S CROSS\\nH\\ne lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. No-\\nbody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that\\nhe was there himself.\\nA long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must\\nexist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, defi-\\nnitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the\\nthing against which he lay existed too.\\nAlmost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became con-\\nscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did\\nnot concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as\\nhe could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that\\nhe had eyes.\\nHe lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever expe-\\nrienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather\\nthe cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which\\nhe lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat,\\nblank something on which to be.\\nHe sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n606\\nwearing glasses anymore.\\nThen a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surr-\\nounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed,\\nand struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the\\nuncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive,\\nshameful.\\nFor the first time, he wished he were clothed.\\nBarely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short dis-\\ntance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were soft, clean, and\\nwarm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the mom-\\nent he had wanted them...\\nHe stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Require-\\nment? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass\\nroof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was\\nhushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises\\ncoming from somewhere close by in the mist...\\nHarry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent\\nthemselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall\\nlarger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling. It was\\nquite empty. He was the only person there, except for –\\nHe recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had\\nthe form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and\\nrough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been\\nleft, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath.\\nHe was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did\\nnot want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump\\nback at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could\\nnot bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but\\nit repulsed him.\\n“You cannot help.”\\nHe spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n607\\nand upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.\\n“Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and\\nwhite and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us\\nwalk.”\\nStunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the\\nflayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not\\npreviously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling\\nceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other,\\nstaring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and\\nbeard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked\\nnose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet...\\n“But you’re dead,” said Harry.\\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. “Then... I’m dead too?”\\n“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the question,\\nisn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.”\\nThey looked at each other, the old man still beaming. “Not?” repeated\\nHarry.\\n“Not,” said Dumbledore.\\n“But...” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It\\ndid not seem to be there. “But I should have died – I didn’t defend myself!\\nI meant to let him kill me!”\\n“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the differ-\\nence.”\\nHappiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry\\nhad never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content.\\n“Explain,” said Harry.\\n“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs\\ntogether.\\n“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”\\n“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!”\\n“So the part of his soul that was in me...”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n608\\nDumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a\\nbroad smile of encouragement on his face.\\n“...has it gone?”\\n“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole,\\nand completely your own, Harry.”\\n“But then...”\\nHarry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature\\ntrembled under the chair.\\n“What is that, Professor?”\\n“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.\\n“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and\\nnobody died for me this time – how can I be alive?”\\n“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he\\ndid, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”\\nHarry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed\\na palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows\\nand bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the\\nstunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer\\nrose to his lips easily, without effort.\\n“He took my blood,” said Harry.\\n“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living\\nbody with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both\\nof you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”\\n“I live... while he lives? But I thought... I thought it was the other way\\nround! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?”\\nHe was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized\\ncreature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.\\n“Are you sure we can’t do anything?”\\n“There is no help possible.”\\n“Then explain... more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.\\n“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n609\\nmake. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he\\ncommitted those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the\\nattempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less\\nthan he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself\\nlatched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.\\n“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which\\nVoldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-\\nelves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows\\nand understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his\\nown, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.\\n“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his\\nbody a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she\\ndied for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment\\nsurvives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. “And you knew\\nthis? You knew – all along?”\\n“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore\\nhappily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the\\ncreature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.\\n“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand break\\nthe wand he borrowed?”\\n“As to that, I cannot be sure.”\\n“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.\\n“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have\\njourneyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But\\nhere is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker\\ncould, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort.\\n“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the\\nbond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul\\nwas still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a\\npart of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have under-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n610\\nstood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps,\\nhave dared to touch your blood... But then, if he had been able to understand,\\nhe could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all.\\n“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your desti-\\nnies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history,\\nVoldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with\\nyours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores\\nreacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was\\ntwin of his, had never expected.\\n“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted,\\neven embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has\\nnever been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And\\nin doing so, something happened between those wands, something that\\nechoed the relationship between their masters.\\n“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of\\nVoldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of\\nVoldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you,\\nrecognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated\\nsome of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than\\nanything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the\\npower of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill:\\nWhat chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?”\\n“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break\\nit?” asked Harry.\\n“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort,\\nwho had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only\\ntoward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand\\nlike any other... though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.\\nHarry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard\\nto be sure of things like time, here.\\n“He killed me with your wand.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n611\\n“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I\\nthink we can agree that you are not dead – though, of course,” he added, as\\nif fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings,\\nwhich I am sure were severe.”\\n“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his\\nclean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”\\n“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.\\n“Where would you say that we are?”\\nUntil Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he\\nfound that he had an answer ready to give.\\n“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner\\nand empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.”\\n“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately.\\n“Good gracious, really?”\\n“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defensively.\\n“My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.”\\nHarry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating.\\nHe glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that\\nof their current location.\\n“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the words\\nwiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.\\n“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried. “Well?”\\nFor the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than\\nan old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in\\nwrongdoing.\\n“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not trusting you?\\nFor not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed.\\nI only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon,\\nHarry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.”\\n“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s\\ntone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n612\\n“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate\\nman’s dream!”\\n“But they’re real!”\\n“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore. “And I was\\nsuch a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore.\\nYou know.”\\n“What do I know?”\\nDumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled\\nin the brilliantly blue eyes.\\n“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than\\nVoldemort?”\\n“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course – how can you ask that?\\nYou never killed if you could avoid it!”\\n“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassu-\\nrance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”\\n“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how\\nodd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumble-\\ndore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.”\\n“Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely.”\\nThere was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no\\nlonger looked around.\\n“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked. Dumbledore closed\\nhis eyes for a moment and nodded.\\n“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two\\nclever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to God-\\nric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus\\nPeverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.”\\n“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers –”\\n“– were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh\\nyes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road... I think it more\\nlikely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n613\\nsucceeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being\\nDeath’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung\\nup around such creations.\\n“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to\\nson, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who\\nwas born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.”\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry. “Me?”\\n“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession\\non the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days\\npreviously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I\\ncould hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it.\\nI had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not\\nresist, could not help taking a closer look... It was a Cloak the likes of which\\nI had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect... and then your\\nfather died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!”\\nHis tone was unbearably bitter.\\n“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry said qui-\\nckly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t\\nhave made them curse-proof.”\\n“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.”\\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.\\n“So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?”\\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to\\nmeet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know. You cannot des-\\npise me more than I despise myself.”\\n“But I don’t despise you –”\\n“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. “You know\\nthe secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she\\nbecame. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price,\\ndied in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care\\nfor Ariana.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n614\\n“I resented it, Harry.”\\nDumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of\\nHarry’s head, into the distance.\\n“I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I want-\\ned glory.”\\n“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face so that he\\nlooked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother\\nand my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a\\nremarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.\\n“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a\\ndamaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and\\nbitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came…”\\nDumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again.\\n“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry,\\ninflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant.\\nGrindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.”\\n“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words.\\nIt would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a\\nhundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what\\nGellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we\\nwere making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.”\\n“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fasci-\\nnated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the wea-\\npon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone – to him, though\\nI pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it\\nmeant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my\\nshoulders.”\\n“And the Cloak... somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry.\\nBoth of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true\\nmagic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others\\nas well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n615\\nhiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the\\ntrio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then\\nbe truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’”\\n“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months\\nof insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my\\nfamily left to me.”\\n“And then... you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of\\nmy rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want\\nto hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not\\nset forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.”\\n“The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I\\nhad always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into\\nterrible being. And Ariana... after all my mother’s care and caution... lay\\ndead upon the floor.”\\nDumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached\\nout and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly\\nand Dumbledore gradually regained control.\\n“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vani-\\nshed, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture,\\nand his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged\\nhim and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to\\nlive with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.”\\n“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured\\na wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister\\nof Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that\\nI was not to be trusted with power.”\\n“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!”\\nburst out Harry.\\n“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had proven,\\nas a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is\\na curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n616\\nthose who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust\\nupon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own\\nsurprise that they wear it well.\\n“I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher –”\\n“You were the best –”\\n“– you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training\\nof young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me,\\nand perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.\\n“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look.\\n“Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly\\nmatched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared.\\nYou see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually\\ncast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would\\nbe right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been\\nI who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and\\nstupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.\\n“I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meet-\\ning him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer.\\nPeople were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.\\n“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.”\\nAnother silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found\\nout who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he\\nwant Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore\\nwould have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why\\nDumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised\\nover Harry.\\nThey sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature\\nbehind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.\\nAt last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the\\nwand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.”\\nDumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n617\\ncrooked nose.\\n“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmen-\\ngard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and\\nshame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt\\nto make amends... to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow...”\\n“... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and Dum-\\nbledore dabbed his eyes.\\nAfter another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Resurrection\\nStone.”\\nDumbledore nodded.\\n“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home\\nof the Gaunts – the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I\\nhad wanted it for very different reasons – I lost my head, Harry. I quite\\nforgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I\\npicked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to\\nsee Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very\\nsorry I was...\\n“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I\\nwas unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again,\\nand here was final proof.”\\n“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see them again.\\nWhat’s wrong with that?”\\n“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only\\nto possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the\\nElder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to\\ntame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.\\n“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have\\nworked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have\\nused in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable\\nmy self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.”\\nDumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n618\\nsmiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dum-\\nbledore now?\\n“Why did you have to make it so difficult?” Dumbledore’s smile was\\ntremulous.\\n“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was\\nafraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that,\\nif presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might\\nseize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you\\nlaid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true\\nmaster of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from\\nDeath. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far\\nworse things in the living world than dying.”\\n“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?”\\n“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone\\nhe turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I\\ndoubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would\\nnot think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he\\nwant to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.”\\n“But you expected him to go after the wand?”\\n“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Volde-\\nmort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you\\nhad conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander,\\nhowever, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that\\nexplained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours!\\nSo Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had\\nmade your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally\\nset out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him,\\nthe Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you.\\nHe believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him\\ntruly invincible. Poor Severus...”\\n“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n619\\nElder Wand, didn’t you?”\\n“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work\\nas I intended, did it?”\\n“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.”\\nThe creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore\\nsat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would\\nhappen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly\\nfalling snow.\\n“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?”\\n“That is up to you.”\\n“I’ve got a choice?”\\n“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross, you say?\\nI think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to... let’s say...\\nboard a train.”\\n“And where would it take me?”\\n“On,” said Dumbledore simply. Silence again.\\n“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.”\\n“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”\\n“But you want me to go back?”\\n“I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to return, there is a chance\\nthat he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry,\\nthat you have less to fear from returning here than he does.”\\nHarry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked\\nin the shadow beneath the distant chair.\\n“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who\\nlive without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are mai-\\nmed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then\\nwe say good-bye for the present.”\\nHarry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard\\nas walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful\\nhere, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n620\\nloss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long\\nmoment into each other’s faces.\\n“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this been happe-\\nning inside my head?”\\nDumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in\\nHarry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring\\nhis figure.\\n“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth\\nshould that mean that it is not real?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n621\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\\nTHE FLAW IN THE PLAN\\nH\\ne was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of the forest fill-\\ned his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and\\nthe hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall,\\ncutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where the\\nKilling Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did\\nnot stir, but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out\\nat an awkward angle and his mouth gaping.\\nHe had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but\\ninstead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air.\\n“My Lord... my Lord...”\\nIt was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare\\nopen his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He\\nknew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel\\nit pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in\\nthe area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there,\\nstuffed out of sight.\\n“My Lord...”\\n“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n622\\nMore footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same spot.\\nDesperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a\\nmillimeter.\\nVoldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were\\nhurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bella-\\ntrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort.\\nHarry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death\\nEaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to\\nthe ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing\\nCurse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them\\nhad fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned...\\n“My Lord, let me –”\\n“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though he could\\nnot see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “The boy...\\nIs he dead?”\\nThere was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry,\\nbut he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the\\nground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.\\n“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain.\\n“Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”\\nHarry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there,\\nwith his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the\\nsame time noting, small comfort though it was, that Voldemort was wary of\\napproaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan...\\nHands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face, pulled\\nback an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart.\\nHe could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face. He\\nknew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs.\\n“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”\\nThe whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her\\nhead bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n623\\n“Yes,” he breathed back.\\nHe felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him. Then it was\\nwithdrawn. She had sat up.\\n“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.\\nAnd now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their\\nfeet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot\\ninto the air in celebration.\\nStill feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the\\nonly way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was\\nas part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort\\nwon.\\n“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is dead\\nby my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!”\\nHarry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to\\nremain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation\\nto prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his\\ndetermination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He\\nwas thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he\\nfelt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and\\nlifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed\\nwith jeers and shrieks of laughter.\\n“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show them what has\\nbecome of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No – Wait –”\\nThere was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry\\nfelt the ground trembling beneath him.\\n“You carry him,” Voldemort said. “He will be nice and visible in your\\narms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses – put\\non the glasses – he must be recognizable –”\\nSomeone slammed Harry’s glasses back onto his face with deliberate\\nforce, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly\\ngentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with the force of his heav-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n624\\ning sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in\\nhis arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to\\nHagrid that all was not, yet, lost.\\n“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way\\nthrough the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught\\nat Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his\\neyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around\\nthem, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a\\npulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter...\\nThe two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear\\ntrees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds\\nrose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were\\ndrowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground,\\nand after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through\\nhis closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. “BANE!”\\nHagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open. “Happy\\nnow, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags? Are yeh\\nhappy Harry Potter’s – d-dead...?”\\nHagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered\\nhow many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open\\nhis eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as\\nthey left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air,\\nthat they had reached the edge of the forest.\\n“Stop.”\\nHarry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort’s\\ncommand, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them\\nwhere they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that\\npatrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his\\nown survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his\\nfather’s stag kept guardian in his heart.\\nSomeone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort him-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n625\\nself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that\\nit swelled through the grounds, crashing upon Harry’s eardrums.\\n“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself\\nwhile you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that\\nyour hero is gone.\\n“The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters\\noutnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more\\nwar. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaught-\\nered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now,\\nkneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your\\nbrothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the\\nnew world we shall build together.”\\nThere was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so\\nclose to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.\\n“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid\\nwas forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw\\nVoldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around\\nhis shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility\\nof extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by\\nthe Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly\\nlightening darkness...\\n“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry... Harry “\\nHarry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the\\ncastle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the\\nDeath Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.\\n“Stop.”\\nThe Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them spreading out in a line\\nfacing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his\\nclosed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the\\nentrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to\\ndie would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n626\\n“NO!”\\nThe scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or\\ndreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard\\nanother woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGo-\\nnagall’s despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open\\ndoorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the\\nfront steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry’s death for\\nthemselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking\\nNagini’s head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again.\\n“No!”\\n“No!”\\n“Harry! HARRY!”\\nRon’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGonagall’s;\\nHarry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent,\\nand their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause,\\nscreaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters, until –\\n“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright\\nlight, and silence was forced upon them all. “It is over! Set him down, Hag-\\nrid, at my feet, where he belongs!”\\nHarry felt himself lowered onto the grass.\\n“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and\\nforward right beside the place where he lay. “Harry Potter is dead! Do you\\nunderstand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied\\non others to sacrifice themselves for him!”\\n“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of\\nHogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful\\nbang extinguished their voices once more.\\n“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said\\nVoldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed while trying\\nto save himself –”\\nBut Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n627\\nbang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal\\namount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort:\\nHarry saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the\\nchallenger’s wand aside and laughing.\\n“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has volunteered\\nto demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle\\nis lost?”\\nBellatrix gave a delighted laugh.\\n“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the\\nCarrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”\\n“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who\\nwas struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the\\nnoman’s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. “But you are a\\npureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” Voldemort asked Neville, who stood\\nfacing him, his empty hands curled in fists.\\n“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly.\\n“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will\\nmake a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Long-\\nbottom.”\\n“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s\\nArmy!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd,\\nwhom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.\\n“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silki-\\nness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is your choice,\\nLongbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said quietly,\\n“be it.”\\nStill watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand.\\nSeconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that\\nlooked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in\\nVoldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it\\ndangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n628\\n“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Voldemort.\\n“There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble\\nancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone. Won’t they, Neville\\nLongbottom?”\\nHe pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the\\nhat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were\\nmovements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the\\nDeath Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.\\n“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone fool-\\nish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with a flick of\\nhis wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.\\nScreams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot,\\nunable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act –\\nAnd then many things happened at the same moment.\\nThey heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sound-\\ned like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and\\npelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp\\ncame lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His\\ncry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: They ran at Grawp like\\nbull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs\\nof bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who\\nbroke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak\\nfrom inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as\\nNeville moved too. In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the\\nBody-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from\\nits depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle –\\nThe slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the\\noncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding\\ncentaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville\\nsliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in\\nthe light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n629\\nin a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded\\nto the ground at his feet –\\nHidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm\\nbetween Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then,\\nover the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling\\ngiants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of all.\\n“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY – WHERE’S HARRY?”\\nChaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters,\\neveryone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thun-\\ndered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw\\ngreat winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort’s giants,\\nthestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp\\npunched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts\\nand Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was\\nshooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they\\ncrumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were\\ntrampled by the retreating crowd.\\nStill hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the\\nentrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the\\nroom, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still\\nscreaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right;\\nHarry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort’s would-be victims, Sea-\\nmus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall,\\nwhere they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.\\nAnd now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps,\\nand Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still\\nwearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of\\nwhat looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who\\nhad remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of\\nHogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall\\nwith a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitch-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n630\\nens was blasted off its hinges.\\nThe house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming\\nand waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of\\nRegulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice\\naudible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender\\nof house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”\\nThey were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters,\\ntheir tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death\\nEaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells,\\ndragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply\\nattempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.\\nBut it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling\\nprisoners, and into the Great Hall.\\nVoldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting\\nall within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer,\\nstill invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as every-\\none who could walk forced their way inside.\\nHarry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw\\nDolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair\\nthrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide\\nunconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir\\nGreyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring\\nThicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd,\\nnot even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.\\nVoldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at\\nonce, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around\\nhim, unable to finish him –\\nBellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like\\nher master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling\\ntheir hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry’s attention was\\ndiverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n631\\nan inch –\\nHe changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but\\nbefore he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.\\n“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”\\nMrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix\\nspun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.\\n“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with\\na swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation\\nas Molly Weasley’s wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange’s\\nsmile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the\\nfloor around the witches’ feet became hot and cracked; both women were\\nfighting to kill.\\n“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come\\nto her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!”\\nHundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Volde-\\nmort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invi-\\nsible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be\\nsure that he would not hit the innocent.\\n“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted Bella-\\ntrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her.\\n“When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”\\n“You – will – never – touch – our – children – again!” screamed Mrs.\\nWeasley.\\nBellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given\\nas he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what\\nwas going to happen before it did.\\nMolly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her\\nsquarely in the chest, directly over her heart.\\nBellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest\\nspace of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the\\nwatching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n632\\nHarry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall,\\nKingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the\\nair, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with\\nthe force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly\\nWeasley.\\n“Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle\\nof the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off\\nthe Invisibility Cloak at last.\\nThe yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of “Harry!”\\n“HE’S ALIVE!” were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence\\nfell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other,\\nand began, at the same moment, to circle each other.\\n“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said loudly, and in the\\ntotal silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s\\ngot to be me.”\\nVoldemort hissed.\\n“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t how he\\nworks, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?”\\n“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just\\nyou and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about\\nto leave for good…”\\n“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and his red\\neyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You think it will be you, do\\nyou, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was\\npulling the strings?”\\n“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry. They\\nwere still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining\\nthe same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Volde-\\nmort’s. “Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that\\nI didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight\\nagain?”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n633\\n“Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the\\nwatching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall,\\nnobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and chance and the fact\\nthat you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women,\\nand permitted me to kill them for you!”\\n“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled,\\nand stared into each other’s eyes, green into red. “You won’t be able to kill\\nany of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from\\nhurting these people –”\\n“But you did not!”\\n“– I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did.\\nThey’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells\\nyou put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them.\\nYou don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”\\n“You dare –”\\n“Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I\\nknow lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you\\nmake another big mistake?”\\nVoldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he\\nkept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held back by the faintest\\npossibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret...\\n“Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering. “Dumble-\\ndore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though\\nlove did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old wax-\\nwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother\\nlike a cockroach, Potter – and nobody seems to love you enough to run\\nforward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when\\nI strike?”\\n“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in\\neach other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.\\n“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you must\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n634\\nbelieve that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful\\nthan mine?”\\n“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike\\nface, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the\\nsound was more frightening than his screams; humorless and insane, it\\nechoed around the silent Hall.\\n“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I, than Lord\\nVoldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never\\ndreamed of?”\\n“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew\\nenough not to do what you’ve done.”\\n“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too weak to dare, too\\nweak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!”\\n“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better\\nman.”\\n“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”\\n“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.”\\nFor the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people\\naround the walls drew breath as one.\\n“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though\\nthey would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays in the marble\\ntomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not\\nreturn!”\\n“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t have him\\nkilled. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died,\\narranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.”\\n“What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did not strike,\\nand his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s.\\n“Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape was Dumbledore’s,\\nDumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother.\\nAnd you never realized it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n635\\nnever saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?”\\nVoldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like\\nwolves about to tear each other apart.\\n“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same as my mother’s,\\nbecause he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were\\nchildren. You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils\\nflare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?”\\n“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had\\ngone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier\\nof him –”\\n“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy\\nfrom the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you\\never since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”\\n“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with\\nrapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not\\nwhether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they\\ntried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s\\nsupposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you\\ndo not understand!\\n“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended\\nthat Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of\\nyou, little boy – I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it,\\nI understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three\\nhours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly\\nmine! Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”\\n“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me,\\nI’d advise you to think about what you’ve done... Think, and try for some\\nremorse, Riddle “\\n“What is this?”\\nOf all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or\\ntaunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils con-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n636\\ntract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.\\n“It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left I’ve seen\\nwhat you’ll be otherwise... Be a man... try... Try for some remorse “\\n“You dare –?” said Voldemort again.\\n“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t\\nbackfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.”\\nVoldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped\\nDraco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away.\\n“That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered\\nthe wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder\\nWand. He never defeated Dumbledore.”\\n“He killed –”\\n“Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s\\ndeath was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated,\\nthe wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power\\nwould have died with him, because it had never been won from him!”\\n“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Volde-\\nmort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from its last\\nmaster’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! Its power is\\nmine!”\\n“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough!\\nHolding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to\\nOllivander? The wand chooses the wizard... The Elder Wand recognized a\\nnew master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand\\non it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will,\\nnever realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most danger-\\nous wand had given him its allegiance “\\nVoldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse\\ncoming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.\\n“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”\\nBlank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n637\\ngone.\\n“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter,\\nit makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix\\nwand: We duel on skill alone... and after I have killed you, I can attend to\\nDraco Malfoy “\\n“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got\\nthere first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”\\nHarry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in\\nthe Hall upon it.\\n“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the\\nwand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does...\\nI am the true master of the Elder Wand.”\\nA red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as\\nan edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The\\nlight hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was\\nsuddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled\\nhis best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand:\\n“Avada Kedavra!”\\n“Expelliarmus!”\\nThe bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted\\nbetween them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading,\\nmarked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green\\njet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise,\\nspinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning\\nthrough the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take\\nfull possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker,\\ncaught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed,\\nthe slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor\\nwith a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands\\nempty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead,\\nkilled by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n638\\nhand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.\\nOne shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and\\nthen the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the\\nroars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows\\nas they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and\\nHermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their\\nincomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna\\nwere there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGo-\\nnagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone\\nwas shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to\\nhug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined\\nto touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last –\\nThe sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life\\nand light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of\\njubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there\\nwith them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he\\nhad not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to\\noccur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness\\ntheir tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every\\nquarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the\\ncountry had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else\\nbeing captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that\\nvery moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary\\nMinister of Magic...\\nThey moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away\\nfrom the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who\\nhad died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but\\nnobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled toge-\\nther, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and\\nFirenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed\\nwindow, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n639\\nwhile, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside\\nLuna.\\n“I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said. “I’d love some,”\\nhe replied.\\n“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”\\nAnd before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering\\nHumdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked\\naround, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.\\nNow he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted\\nGinny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s\\nshoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years\\nin which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his\\nplate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle\\nbetween the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled\\ntogether as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there,\\nbut nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw\\nfamilies reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved\\nmost.\\n“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them. “Will you come\\nwith me?”\\nThey stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione left the Great\\nHall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the\\nbalustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as\\nthey climbed.\\nSomewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the\\ncorridors singing a victory song of his own composition:\\nWe did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one,\\nAnd Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!\\n“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?”\\nsaid Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n640\\nHappiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled\\nby exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him\\nlike a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stipend-\\nous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron\\nand Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the\\ntruth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what\\nhad happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their\\nshock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they\\nhad been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.\\nSince he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the head-\\nmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little\\npunch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish\\npasswords anymore.\\n“Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle. “Feel free,” groaned the statue.\\nThey clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved\\nslowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top.\\nHe had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had\\nleft it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses\\nand returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort –\\nBut it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and head-\\nmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved\\ntheir hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames\\nto grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which\\nthey had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter For-\\ntescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high,\\nreedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let\\nour contribution not be forgotten!”\\nBut Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait\\ndirectly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from\\nbehind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n641\\nthe gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoen-\\nix song.\\nAt last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent,\\nbeaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He\\ndirected his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous\\ncare. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last\\neffort, seeking one last piece of advice.\\n“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped it in the\\nforest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it\\nagain. Do you agree?”\\n“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked\\nconfused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I\\nwould have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?”\\n“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.\\n“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumble-\\ndore beamed.\\n“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!”\\n“And then there’s this.”\\nHarry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with\\na reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did\\nnot like to see.\\n“I don’t want it,” said Harry.\\n“What?” said Ron loudly. “Are you mental?”\\n“I know it’s powerful,” said Harry wearily. “But I was happier with mine.\\nSo...”\\nHe rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two\\nhalves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather.\\nHermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was\\ntoo severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would.\\nHe laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the\\nvery tip of the Elder Wand, and said, “Reparo.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n642\\nAs his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he\\nhad succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden\\nwarmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their\\nreunion.\\n“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was watching\\nhim with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from. It\\ncan stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken,\\nwon’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the\\nend of it.”\\nDumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.\\n“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his\\nvoice as he looked at the Elder Wand.\\n“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly.\\n“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And quite\\nhonestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of\\nthe four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and won-\\ndering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had\\nenough trouble for a lifetime.”\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n643\\nEPILOGUE\\nNINETEEN YEARS LATER\\nA\\nutumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first\\nof September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family\\nbobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes\\nof car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the\\ncold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were\\npushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl\\ntrailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm. “It won’t be\\nlong, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her. “Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I\\nwant to go now!”\\nThe commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way\\ntoward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted\\nback to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argu-\\nment they had started in the car.\\n“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!”\\n“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.\\n“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother.\\n“There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth –”\\nBut James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five Potters app-\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n644\\nroached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his\\nyounger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a\\nrun. A moment later, he had vanished.\\n“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately,\\ncapitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.\\n“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.\\n“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get\\nletters from home about once a month.”\\n“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.\\n“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,”\\nHarry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”\\nSide by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As\\nthey reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the\\nfamily emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured\\nby thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express.\\nIndistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had\\nalready disappeared.\\n“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they\\npassed as they made their way down the platform.\\n“We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly.\\nBut the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces.\\nDetached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry\\nthought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and\\nwas quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello...\\n“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly.\\nA group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the\\nvery last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny,\\nLily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.\\n“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.\\nRose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed\\nat him.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n645\\n“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn’t\\nbelieve I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have to\\nConfund the examiner.”\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”\\n“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as\\ntogether they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to\\nlook in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm\\nfor that.”\\nBack on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother,\\nhaving an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into\\nwhen they finally went to Hogwarts.\\n“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no\\npressure.”\\n“Ron!”\\nLily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.\\n“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer\\npaying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some\\nfifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people\\nstood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.\\n“Look who it is.”\\nDraco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat\\nbuttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which empha-\\nsized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus\\nresembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny\\nstaring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.\\n“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure you\\nbeat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother’s\\nbrains.”\\n“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused. “Don’t\\ntry to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!”\\n“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added,\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n646\\n“Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would\\nnever forgive you if you married a pureblood.”\\n“Hey!”\\nJames had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and\\ntrolley, and was evidently bursting with news.\\n“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoul-\\nder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And guess what he’s\\ndoing? Snogging Victoire!”\\nHe gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.\\n“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I\\nasked Teddy what he was doing –”\\n“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron –”\\n“– and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away.\\nHe’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had not made him-\\nself clear.\\n“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily ecstatically.\\n“Teddy would really be part of the family then!”\\n“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry.\\n“Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?”\\n“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing with Al –\\nTeddy could have my room!”\\n“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want\\nthe house demolished.”\\nHe checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett’s.\\n“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”\\n“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged\\nhim.\\n“Mum! I can’t give a professor love!”\\n“But you know Neville –”\\nJames rolled his eyes.\\n“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n647\\nwalk into Herbology and give him love “\\nShaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by\\naiming a kick at Albus.\\n“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.”\\n“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!”\\nBut James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his\\nfather a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him\\nwave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.\\n“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus. “They’re gentle\\nthings, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up\\nto school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.”\\nGinny kissed Albus good-bye. “See you at Christmas.”\\n“Bye, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget Hagrid’s\\ninvited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone\\ntill you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.”\\n“What if I’m in Slytherin?”\\nThe whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the mo-\\nment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere\\nthat fear was.\\nHarry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own.\\nAlone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes.\\n“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could\\nhear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was\\nnow on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One\\nof them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”\\n“But just say –”\\n“– then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it?\\nIt doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose\\nGryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”\\n“Really?”\\n“It did for me,” said Harry.\\x0cJ.K. Rowling HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\\n648\\nHe had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder\\nin Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along\\nthe scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward\\nfor final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and\\nGinny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the win-\\ndows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seem-\\ned to be turned toward Harry.\\n“Why are they all staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose craned\\naround to look at the other students.\\n“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely famous.”\\nAlbus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry\\nwalked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excite-\\nment. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little Berea-\\nvement, watching his son glide away from him...\\nThe last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a\\ncorner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.\\n“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny.\\nAs Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched\\nthe lightning scar on his forehead.\\n“I know he will.”\\nThe scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\\x0cText copyright © 1998 by J.K.
